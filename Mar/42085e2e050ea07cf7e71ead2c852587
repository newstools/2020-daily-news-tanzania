WOMEN groups receiving funds from Non-Governmental Organization (NGOs) and financial institutions to run various projects must be disciplined in expenditures that is also a prerequisite for loans acquisition. Speaking here recently, the Director of a Non-Governmental Organisation, implementing Action Aid Programmes—AFNET, Sarah Mwanga said that loans was a challenge that is why many financial institutions cite efficiency as the backbone for the groups. “Loans are becoming a big issue and recently we had a meeting with Dodoma Urban lawmaker, Anthony Mavunde, who underscored the need for the groups to increase efficiency, adding that some clusters, which display trust and manage well funds get financial assistance as loans,’’ she added. Clarifying, the Director said that some women groups and youth were receiving up to 100m/-as loans and on time paying back, because they engage themselves in efficient economic activities. According to her, last year for example, there were various priorities including economic rights for women and Gender Based Violence, where some donors released funds to enable women fight for their rights. “If we form serious groups in our communities, we are likely to go stage after stage and weed out problems facing women like Female Genital Mutilation (FGM),’’ she said. However, Chamwino District Community Development Officer, Sophia Swai said women groups, youth and people living with disabilities have a challenge on paying back the loans. “Some groups do not clear their outstanding debts within the agreed timeframe, but others only clear their loans and borrow afresh,’’ she said. According to her about 35.5m/-was released to 16 groups of pastoralists and farmers in eight Wards of Manchali, Buigiri, Chilonwa, Chamwino, Mvumi, Mlowa Barabarani,  Makangwa and Msanga within the district.
