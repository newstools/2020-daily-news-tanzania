THE state-owned Tanzania Shipping Agencies Corporation (TASAC) has expressed its satisfaction over the ongoing rehabilitation and expansion of two ports in the South of Lake Tanganyika. The two ports are Kabwe in Nkasi and Kasanga in Kalambo Districts in Rukwa region, whose mega renovation and expansion is set to cost about 11bn/-. Upon completion the ports which are manned by Tanzania Ports Authority (TPA) will save as social and economic gateways to the regions of Katavi and Rukwa which are South of Lake Tanganyika. The Registration and Marine Inspection Manager at TASAC Mr Alfred Waryama urged owners of marine vessels to equip their vessels with enough protection gear including life-saving jackets. Speaking with the ‘Daily News’ on the shoreline of Lake Tanganyika at Kirando village, Mr Waryama also advised the marine vessels owners to renew their licences each year. “The big challenge here is that motor cargos and passenger boats plying on Lake Tanganyika as well fishing canoes have not yet either registered or renewed their licences. All the vessels are either lacking protection gears or they are not enough hence risking the lives of passengers,” he added. He further explained that during their two days working tour led by TASAC Director General, Mr Emanuel Ndomba, they visited and inspected Kasanga and Kipili Ports as well as fish stock structure at Kirando Ward along the shoreline of Lake Tanganyika.
