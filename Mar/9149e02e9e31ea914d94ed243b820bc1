PUPILS from five primary schools in Tanga recently undertook the Youth Activation programme which aims at building self confidence as part of implementing Learn Unified, Play Unified project run by Special Olympics Tanzania (SOT). The programme involved ten athletes and ten partners, who together demonstrated some leadership skills on what they can do to raise awareness by themselves if they see that something somewhere is going wrong. Briefing the 'Daily News' about the project, one of the facilitators from Mwakidila Primary School Tyson Mhanga described the programme as very successful to all the pupils who took part saying it will benefit them a lot. " As you know, these children are the future leaders of our country that is why it is very important to impart them some leadership skills so that they can easily speak by themselves without seeking any assistance when something is not right," he said. He added that the big turnout of the pupils symbolised that they were ready to receive the skills bearing in mind that some of them came from schools which are located far away. Moreover, Mhanga disclosed that many people have problems to speak in public despite having good academic qualifications a thing he said can only be solved by arranging such programmes to primary school pupils so that they should grow up with it.
