AT least 10 primary schools in Dodoma City have embarked on a digital education programme after receiving 700 tablets from ProFuturo and Don Bosco. In line with Goal 4 of the United Nations’ 2030 sustainable development agenda on access to equitable and inclusive quality education for all, ProFuturo seeks to become a world reference for transformation and innovation in education. Speaking during the handover of tablets, Dodoma District Commissioner (DC) Patrobas Katambi said the tablets should be used to improve academic performance. “Schools which have received should keep them well and use them to improve academic performance,” said the DC during the ceremony. The brain behind the digital education programme to Dodoma City-based primary schools is Dodoma Urban MP Anthony Mavunde, who is also Deputy Minister of State in the Prime Minister’s Office (Policy, Parliamentary Affairs, Labour, Employment, Youth and People with Disabilities). Mr Katambi commended the Dodoma Urban MP for coming up with the idea to introduce the digital education programme in primary schools, noting that the schools should cooperate with the MP through using the programme to improve academic performance. “Since I resumed office as DC in Dodoma, I have learnt that the MP loves his people and he has heavily invested in education,” he remarked. For his part, Mr Mavunde expressed gratitude to the ProFuturo for donating tablets to pupils in the area. “I am thankful to ProFuturo for this contribution of tablets which will have a big impact on academic development,” he said. Earlier, the representative of ProFuturo and Don Bosco, Fr Peter Mutechura, promised the MP to keep on partnering in his plans to address challenges facing primary education in Dodoma. Primary schools which received the tablets are Mlimwa, Mbwanga, Ihumwa, Chigongwe and Mazengo.
