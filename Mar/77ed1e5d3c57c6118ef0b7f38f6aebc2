NIC Bank Tanzania yesterday marked the international women in Dar es Salaam day by donating fistula diagnoses equipment to the Comprehensive Community Based Rehabilitation in Tanzania (CCBRT) Hospital in the city. During the occasion, the Bank’s Managing Director, Ms Margret Karume said that apart from the donation, the bank has been providing equal employment opportunities to the locals regardless of one’s sex in the society. “Supporting the community is our role and we have key strategies, where the bank is implementing by helping our women,” she said, adding that by supporting a woman, you are actually supporting the whole society. The International Women’s Day is a global day that celebrates social, economic, cultural and political achievements, women have realised to accelerate gender equality. To support the community and society during the day, the bank thought of partnering with the hospital that supports women against the disease. The theme of the International Women’s Day 2020 according to the bank was ‘Each4Equal’ and drawn from the notion of ‘collective individualism. Equality is not a women’s issue, it’s a business issue. Gender equality demands that all women are empowered with a focus to identify and address power imbalances, which sideline them.
