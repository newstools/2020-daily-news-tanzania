IN a bid to easy and improve services, the Tanzania Electric Supply Company Limited (Tanesco) has launched an online app that will enable customers to access the company’s services at their fingertips. Minister for Energy, Dr Medard Kalemani said during the launch over the weekend that the app will enable Tanesco customers to save time, money and minimize inconvenience in getting services. He said the new system will also help the company to collect revenue easily and advised the public to apply it. “The system will also enable the company to register many customers easily and on time,” he said. The Minister said the new system will help Tanesco to easily identify illegal customers and thus enable the company to take legal procedures. The company’s senior manager for ICT, Mr Demistris Dashina said the app is for providing emergency information to customers and enable them to send complaints about the company. He said the new system will increase productivity and enable customers to access crucial information as required and on time. The Minister called on other institutions such as Rural Energy Agency (REA), Tanzania Petroleum Development Corporation (TPDC), Energy and Water Utilities Regulatory Authority (EWURA) and others to adopt the system so as to improve service delivery.
