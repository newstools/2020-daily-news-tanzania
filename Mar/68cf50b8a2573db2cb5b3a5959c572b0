PREVENTION and Combating of Corruption Bureau (PCCB) in Dodoma region has dragged to court a former Chama cha Mapinduzi (CCM) Dodoma District Chairman for allegedly forging, conspiring and using phony documents. The thirty-nine year old Robert Mwinje was charged yesterday along with his office attendant, Nyemo Malenda (20) at the Residence Magistrates Court in Dodoma’s Central Business District. According to PCCB Regional Commander, Sosthenes Kibwengo, the two committed the offence between October 18 and 20, 2019 contrary to Penal Code no 16 and its amendments of 2018. At the court, Kibwengo pointed out that during the dates, Mr Mwinje, being the chairman and Malenda being the Office Attendant, forged an appointment letter for aspiring new party leaders. He said the forged letter printed by the party’s district management was submitted to a party stalwart as an authority and decision for the post, yet knowingly it was a flop. Meanwhile, Tanzania Teachers Commission acting Secretary in Bahi District, Mr Adam Richard (49) has been taken to Bahi District Court for soliciting a bribe of 1.5m/-, but received only 553,000/- down payment to promote four teachers at their places of work. Richard now faces four counts for breaching section 15(1) of the PCCB act number 329 of 2018. “We were tipped that the civil servant has been soliciting bribes, yet promoting teachers is part and parcel of his work. “We embarked on our investigations and found that between April and June 2019 he demanded and received money from the teachers, who needed promotion. “Equally, we received a lot of more terrifying information…, but we’re still working on them and we expect to charge him afterwards,” said the PCCB Regional Commander.
