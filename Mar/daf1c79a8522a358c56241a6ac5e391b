BUKOBA District Commissioner (DC), Deodatus Kinawiro has strongly warned a few people who circulate false information regarding the coronavirus pandemic, saying legal measures will be taken against them. Mr Kinawiro issued the warning on Thursday morning while addressing heads of departments and other government workers at the Kaitaba Stadium in Bukoba Municipality. “I have received reports that there are people circulating false information through social media that a patient had been admitted to Bukoba Regional Referral hospital and proved positive with coronavirus. This information is unfounded and baseless. All the updated information will be released by the Ministry of Health, Community Development, Gender, Elderly and Children who are working hard to address the problem,” he said. He directed Ward Executive Officers (WEOs) to educate people in their respective areas on how to avoid contracting the disease and avoid public gatherings. He also directed them to monitor closely people who were reported to be conducting nursery centres for children and close them immediately. On Tuesday, Prime Minister Kassim Majaliwa announced that Tanzania has stepped up its action plan to contain the spread of coronavirus, with the government ordering a month-long closure of all nursery, primary and secondary schools in the country. The government has also suspended Form Six national examination which was scheduled to commence on May 4, this year, directing the students to remain calm as the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology works on a new timetable which will also be determined on the success of the anti Covid- 19 fight.
