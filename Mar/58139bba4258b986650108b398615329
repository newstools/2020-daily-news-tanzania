PLANS are underway to extend banking facilities to reach hundreds of Murusagamba residents in Ngara District, it has been said. Ngara District Commissioner (DC), Lt Col Michael Mtenjele, told ‘Daily News’ during an interview that plans were underway to extend banking facilities to reach Murusagamba Ward and Rulenge Division. "Recently, we convened a full council meeting and one of the agenda items was to extend banking facilities to Murusagamba Ward and Rulenge Division. Officials under NMB and CRDB banks also attended the meeting. We are hopeful that the banking services will start in due time," he said. Ngara District Council Chairman Erick Nkilamachumu appealed to NMB and CRDB banks to open branches in Murusagamba Ward, noting that customers had to travel long distances to Ngara to access banking services. “The distance from Murusagamba to Ngara Township is almost 104km and this poses a big challenge to them,” he said. NMB Ngara Branch Manager Godfrey Martin and CRDB Branch Manager, Herman Balangira both expressed the necessity to have banking facilities in Rulenge and Murusagamba, adding that they had submitted applications to their headquarters for further action.
