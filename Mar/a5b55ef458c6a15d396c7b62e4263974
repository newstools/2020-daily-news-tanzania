The Kisutu Resident Magistrate's Court in Dar es Salaam is overwhelmed by the huge turnout of people, who have come to witness delivery of judgment in the trial of nine senior officials with Chadema, including National Chairman Freeman Mbowe, who are facing 13 sedition charges. Among notable figures in attendance include Seif Sharrif Hamad, the Chief Advisor with ACT Wazalendo part. The open court room where Principal Resident Magistrate Thomas Simba is scheduled to deliver the judgment has been filled beyond capacity. The huge turnout has forced the police force in Dar es Salaam to deploy a good number of armed policemen to strengthen security around the court premises. Several people, mainly from the country's main opposition party started arriving at the court premises early in the morning to witness the outcome of the trial. All accused persons facing the charges are already in court, some looking composed, but others in a state of fear, as no one is sure what will be the court's verdict. Initially, the court had arranged to deliver the judgment at around 10.30 am today, but due to some inconveniences the session has been bushed forward to 7.30pm. Apart from Mbowe, other  accused persons facing the trial are the former party’s Secretary General Vicent  Mashinji , John Mnyika, the newly elected Secretary General and Salum Mwalimu, who is Deputy Secretary General (Zanzibar). Others are Peter Msigwa (Member of Parliament (MP) for Iringa Urban, Halima Mdee, the MP for Kawe, John Heche, the MP for Tarime Rural and Ester Bulaya, who is MP for Bunda Urban as well as the MP for Tarime Urban, Ester Matiko.
