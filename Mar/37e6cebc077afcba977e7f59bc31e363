ZIMAMOTO laboured to overpower New West with 43-38 win in a thrilling Isles Basketball League match staged here on Monday at Mao Zedong court. New West played brilliant in all four quarters despite losing at the end. The league’s organisers said all the matches of the ongoing league have been very thrilling, something they see as a huge success of this season’s league. Still New West, one of the oldest basketball clubs in Zanzibar, have not recorded any victory in all their matches they have played so far. The basketball fans who attended the game failed to predict the winner as both teams displayed good and highly competitive game. Zimamoto played well in the first quarter to claim a 10-6 lead at the end of it, but New West came strongly in the second half and managed to overpower Zimamoto with 15-12 lead. The game turned hotter in the third and the fourth quarters, but Zimamoto held on to claim a 43-38 victory. Also claimed a vital win this week are Zanzibar basketball giants Stone Town who clobbered Nyuki 50 -45 in a closely fought encounter
