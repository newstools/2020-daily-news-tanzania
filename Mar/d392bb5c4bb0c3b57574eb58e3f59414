England has decided to suspend all elite football leagues until April 3, this year, as a result of the spread of coronavirus. The British Broadcasting Corporation has reported that all Premier League games, EFL fixtures and matches in the FA Women's Super League and Women's Championship have been postponed. The Premier League management said clubs would return to the action on 4 April "subject to medical advice and conditions at the time". The English Football Association (FA) said games against Italy on 27 March and Denmark four days later are off. Meanwhile, the EFL, which hopes to resume play a day earlier, said clubs were also advised to suspend "non-essential activities" such as "player appearances, training ground visits and fan meetings". The suspension comes on a day of widespread sporting postponements worldwide.
