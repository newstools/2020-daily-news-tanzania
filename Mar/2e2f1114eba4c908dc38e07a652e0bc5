TTCL Corporation has pledged to provide reliable and efficient videoconferencing services to the Southern African Development Community (SADC ) council of ministers meeting that was slated for next week. The regional bloc announced on Tuesday to abandon face-to-face mode of conducting its meetings through videoconference as a preventive measure against the coronavirus outbreak. The TTCL Corporation Public Relation Manager Ms Puyo Nzalayaimisi said in Dar es Salaam yesterday that the state owned Telecom C ompany is positioned to facilitate the SADC council of ministers’ meeting by providing high quality videoconferencing services. “TTC L is ready to provide efficient videoconferencing services to make sure that the SADC council of ministers’ meeting is successful,” she said. The ministers will participate in the meeting through video from their countries. The decision to use videoconference came following recommendation from SADC ministers responsible for health in the region, who met to discuss the epidemic on Monday. Speaking at a press conference in Dar es Salaam, Ambassador Ibuge said that following the recommendation from health ministers, the Council of Ministers’ meeting would be held next Wednesday (March 18) via video conference. Initially, the programme showed that the senior officials’ meeting will be held from March 12-14, but after choosing the videoconferencing, the ministers decided to drop some agendas of the meeting and reduced the number of days. TTCL Corporation is continuing to roll out a high speed fibre optic cable network to the SADC member states and currently, Zambia and Malawi have already been connected.
