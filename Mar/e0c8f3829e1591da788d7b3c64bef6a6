Tanzanian professional boxer, Hassan Mwakinyo is ready, looking to claim WBO International title in a 12-round super welterweight fight against Jack Culcay of Germany next weekend. The fight between Mwakinyo (25) alias ‘Champez’ and Culcay (34) alias ‘Golden Jack’ will be staged at Halle in Wuppertal, Nordrhein-Westfalen, Germany on Saturday. Speaking in Dar es Salaam yesterday, Mwakinyo’s promoter, Jay Msangi said all necessary preparations ahead of the fight are going on well and that Mwakinyo has promised to continue flying the country’s flag high. Msangi said that Tanzanians can watch live broadcast of the fight via Swahili Flix. “The good news is that the fight will be broadcast live via Swahili Flix from 9pm on Saturday, and this will give boxing lovers in Tanzania and other parts of the World to see yet another their own prodigy fighter taking to the big stage. “What is required for boxing fans is just to download the Swahili Flix app through their mobile phones or their computer through swahiliflix.tv,” said Msangi. Msangi said that Mwakinyo, who is ranked top in Africa and 20th in the World in super welterweight, will become the first Tanzanian boxer to battle for the WBO International title. In his last fight Mwakinyo won by majority decision (MD) against Arnel Tinampay from Philippines in an entertaining international non-title bout at the Uhuru Stadium in Dar es Salaam on November 29th last year. On his side, Culcay beat Jama Saidi by unanimous decision (UD) in his last fight, which took place on November 23rd last year.
