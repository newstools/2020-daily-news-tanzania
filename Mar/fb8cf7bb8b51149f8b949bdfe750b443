TANZANIA China Friendship Promotion Association (TCFPA) in partnership with China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation Ltd (CCECC) has promised to cooperate with the government to repair damaged infrastructures in Kilwa District, Lindi Region, following the recent downpours. The Association Executive Secretary, Mr Joseph Kahama made the remark recently in the district, while donating some humanitarian aids, including footwear, clothes, blankets and medicines among others, to over 3,774 households whose about 15,096 flood victims were rendered homeless, and hence lack food. “Right now, we are giving these humanitarian aid, and then will see how to collaborate with the government in the rehabilitation of the completely damaged infrastructures in this district,” said Mr Kahama. Similarly, according to him, TCFPA also organised a trip of medical experts from China to visit Kilwa in the coming two months, who will also provide medical assistance to the flood victims in 16 villages of the district. On his part, Kilwa District Commissioner (DC), Mr Christopher Ngubiagai noted that the floods caused serious damages to their infrastructures and led to shut down of some of their Schools. “Njinjo Primary school was one of the institutions, whose infrastructures were badly damaged and forced to shift its pupils to neighbouring ones. “We are thankful to all Good Samaritans who have been emerging to help the victims. The government has been also taking various approaches to return the situation back to normalcy. This includes provision of planned plots as well as coordinating various grants for flood victims,” said the DC.
