AT least 583 participants have applied to take part in the upcoming National Competition for Science, Technology and Innovation (STI) scheduled for March 16 in Dodoma City. Director of Science, Technology and Innovation Department in the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology, Prof Maulilio Kipanyula, noted during a recent media workshop that this year’s number of applicants had increased compared to last year. “The Ministry of Education, Science and Technology used 50.55bn/- for 145 projects of 517 researchers in postgraduate courses last year,” said the director during the workshop. Prof Kipanyula explained that the funded projects included one of developing new maize seedlings, beans, paddy and sweet potatoes as well as cat urine to chase the rats out. He pointed out the government had given 750m/- to develop 60 innovators who took part in previous competitions and that among the innovators include the one who came up with an idea to make a chopper. “Mr Adam Kinyekire who came up with the idea to make the chopper will receive 99m/- for setting up his own workshop which will be used to create more innovations,” he said. Prof Kipanyula said the government was determined to recognise innovators from the grassroots, saying the innovations which would receive support should have an impact on national development. He said the government received 415 applications last year from various categories, saying after sorting out, 60 participants were selected to take part in the competition. “About 18 participants were selected from 60 applications. But the government made the decision to support all participants,” he said. Prof Kinyekire said a researcher who came up with the idea to make a chopper had been connected to Nyumbu Corporation to see how to develop his idea, saying the funds he had received from the government would motivate more innovations from his workshop
