IN efforts to curb unemployment in the country, Malembo Farms institution in collaboration with other stakeholders has come up with ‘Ndoto Yangu’ project aimed at building the capacities of higher learning students in self-employment, particularly in agriculture. The Director of Malembo Farms, Mr Lucas Malembo said that the project will cover six regions, where over 70 universities will benefit. According to him, Ndoto Yangu project will help to change the mindsets of youths in the country in selfemployment, especially in the agriculture sector. “This is a sustainable project. We expect to start in Mbeya and Morogoro region as soon as possible. We train university students on how to use agricultural opportunities in self-employment once they complete their studies. The project will move to other regions, including Dodoma, Arusha, Dar es Salaam, Mwanza, and Pemba Kusini,” Mr Malembo explained. He added that they decided to focus on university students (University tour) as a large group of young people who will complete their studies and expect to be employed by the government or any other private institution or companies. He said Malembo Farms is an emerging agri-business consulting firm that supports clients to bring new agricultural projects to realization, and also helps clients to achieve performance improvement within existing projects in an environmentally, socially and economically sustainable manner.
