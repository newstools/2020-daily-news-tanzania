THE Netherlands based Development Organization-SNV has embarked on a pro-biotic (nutritional) yoghurt project with the intention of improving the economic and health status of residents in Hai District. That was revealed recently by the SNV Deputy Manager (Milk Project), Paschal Tekwi, when addressing a symposium which was held in Siha District, in Kilimanjaro Region during the district’s version celebrations of the International Women Day. “The project is now on a pilot level in Hai District, Kilimanjaro Region, whereby three co-operative societies are involved in that pilot project. We at SNV are optimistic that if it takes off fully after the pilot basis, the project will improve the women economic status, health status and the general economies of the areas where the project will be implemented,” she said. Speaking during the occasion, the Siha District Commissioner (DC), Onesmo Buswelu, said the Government valued and respected women because of the role they play in building the nation and that’s why it improves health facilities especially those based on maternal health which are related directly to women. “The Government has embarked on different maternal health projects which are meant to improve the well-being of mother and child care because it is well aware that women’s good health is also for the nation’s economy because of the role they play in building the national economy”, he said in a speech read on his behalf by the Kilimanjaro Regional Education Officer, Ms Paulina Mkwama. She urged different development stakeholders to make sure they contribute for women development programmes due to the importance of women in building the economy of the nation.
