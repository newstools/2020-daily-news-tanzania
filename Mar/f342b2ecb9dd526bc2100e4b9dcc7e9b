TANZANIA cricket team considers resuming training for ICC Men’s T-20 African Q ualifiers soon after coronavirus threat is overcome. The T-20 is still fixed to start on April 25th and climax on May 4th this year in South Africa as there is no statement to postpone it as it has been in other major tournaments worldwide. The Tanzania Cricket Authority (TCA), Communication Officer, Atif Salim told the “DailyNews” that they expect to resume training in small numbers with one-on-one drills to maintain skills of players at the individual level while insisting that the players’ health and safety get top priority. “We are looking forward to resume trainings right after we are assured the disease (COVID-19) is monitored and our players are safe to interact as health comes first before sports,” said Atif. He added that all the players are doing well and they are taking all important measures to avoid contact with the outbreak. “The players are doing fine and are in perfect health though they have still to take self-measures and are monitoring themselves to avoid getting into contact with COVID-19.” The national team returned home from Zimbabwe last Saturday evening where they conducted six T-20 build-up matches against Rhinos at Kwekwe Sports Club in Harare, Zimbabwe whereas they won two matches and lost four. The team is expected to step out for training soon after their arrival but they had to halt training after TCA Chairman, Premji Pindoria announced a suspension of all cricket activities on March 17th this year following COVID-19 outbreak. Through those trainings, the head coach Steve Tikolo expects to trim his squad from 18 to 16 players. Tanzania is placed in group A alongside Mozambique, Botswana, Cameroon, Sierra Leone and St. Helena while group B comprises of Uganda, Ghana, Lesotho, Malawi, Rwanda, Seychelles and eSwatini.
