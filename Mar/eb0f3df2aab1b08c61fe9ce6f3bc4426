AS the world eagerly waits for a scientific breakthrough in the fight against the deadly Coronavirus, religious faithful have been urged to seek for Godâ€™s intervention. The call on people to turn to God dominated Friday prayers here as clerics put emphasis on prayers and asking God (Allah) for forgiveness, mercy, and protection. "Religions tell us when facing difficult times, we should turn to God, asking for forgiveness and save us from calamities. Therefore disasters like coronavirus should also be faced with prayers," Sheikh Juma Mmanga told worshippers at Welesi Mosque, Kikwajuni. Similar messages were echoed in other mosques in both Unguja and Pemba as religious leaders asked people to, in addition to prayers, follow health precautions. Since the coronavirus outbreak in China in December last year, scientists have been working tirelessly to look for treatment for the disease which has already paralysed trade, transport, and socialisation across the globe. Meanwhile although there are still a few COVID- 19 cases reported in Zanzibar, the government through its leaders in various areas of Zanzibar has been taking special measures that aim to combat the disease. In Unguja South region, regional administrative structures are in the frontline in raising awareness to community members, including commuter transport, sellers and buyers in major and small markets. Addressing residents in one of the awareness campaigns in Kizimkazi coastal village, Unguja South Regional Commissioner (RC) Mr Ayoub Mohammed Mahmoud urged the public not to panic because the government is doing everything possible to make sure that they are safe. He said it is high time all leaders from all levels take their responsibility and reach the wide range of communities to inspire, motivate and engage them in the fight against coronavirus.
