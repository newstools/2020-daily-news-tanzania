AT least 600 youth from all five districts of Dar es Salaam have been trained over entrepreneurship skills, financial management and forming income-generating groups. Funded by the Foundation for Civil Society (FCS), Babawatoto organisation organised the training to build capacity among the youth amidst unemployment challenges among them. Executive director of the Babawatoto organisation, Mr Mgunga Mwamnyenyelwa said the training aimed at encouraging the youth participate in economic activities for the betterment of the country’s development. “We expect that after the training the youth would be able to form groups and benefit from loans offered by the district and municipal councils,” he said at the closing session of the training recently. Minister of State in the President’s Office (Regional Administration and Local Governments), Mr Selemani Jafo officiated the closing ceremony in Dar es Salaam. When spoke, Mr Jafo gave until next June for all councils to issue loans to youth, women and people with disabilities, otherwise, stern measures will be taken against them. “Failure to provide loans to these groups is to deny them opportunity,” Mr Jafo stated. He also directed community development officers in the councils to continue incubating the youth by imparting in them skills for realizing their goals. He made the same statement when speaking in Kisarawe District over the last weekend where he told District Executive Directors (DEDs) who fail to allocate funds for special groups to consider themselves unfit for those positions. Mr Jafo argued that allocating 10 per cent for youth, women and people with disabilities was legal requirement, thus, failure to do so was subject to breaching the law. "I give until June 30 to all DEDs to fulfill this budget allocation, otherwise they shall write letter to explain," he said.
