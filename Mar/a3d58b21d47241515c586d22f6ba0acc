THE domestic market was bearish during the first week of March after the Tanzania Share Index (TSI) lost 5.06 points following a 0.14percent decline of the domestic market capitalisation. The TSI closed the week at 3,513.95 points while the domestic market capitalisation closed the week at 9,228.09bn/-(4.01bn US dollar) from 9,241.39bn/-(4.02bn US dollar) at the end of the previous week. The domestic market followed a drop on two domestic counters, CRDB and DSE, by 2.86percent and 1.11percent respectively. CRDB price dropped to170/- from last week’s 175/- as the counter keeps cooling down from the heated appreciation seen in the beginning of February. Investors are eagerly waiting for the bank’s dividend announcement, expected around mid-April. DSE closed at 890/- from previous week’s 900/-. DSE has been volatile in the past two weeks as the counter finds its balance with investors’ excitement on dividend expectations for the year 2019. The profit of DSE for 2019 was inflated by the historical transaction between Vodacom Group SA and Mirambo (T) Ltd. Investors are still blindfolded on how DSE shall treat the transaction in the dividend disbursement, as either profits from the transaction shall be fair game or DSE shall treat the transaction as a one-off event hence retain the earnings. Equity turnover went down by 99percent, from previous week’s 18.78bn/-(8.16m US dollar) to 182.2m/- (0.079m US dollar). The volume of shares also fell by 98.6percent from 28.5mln shares to 0.397mln shares during the week under review. Market activities have significantly dropped due to lowered activities on the TBL counter after a dry up of off-market block transactions. Due to foreign investors’ influence on the TBL counter, we expect muted activities on the counter as the global financial investment arena grapples with the uncertainties and anxiety brought by the coronavirus. Top mover for the week was Twiga Cement (DSE: TPCC) which accounted for 43.8percent of the total equity turnover during the week. Twiga was followed by CRDB and DSE which accounted for 29.28percent and 18percent respectively. On the other hand, the All Share Index (DSEI) climbed 19.07 points to close the week at 2,055.94 points following a 0.94percent uptick of the total market capitalization. The total capitalization closed the week at 17,069.12bn/-(7.42bn US dollar) compared to the previous week’s 16,910.83bn/-(7.35bn US dollar). The appreciation of the DSEI follows an appreciation of 6.67percent and 1.52percent on the KCB and NMG counters on the cross listed board. The counters more than offset the depreciating effect of JHL and EABL which dropped by 2.6percent and 0.66percent respectively. Local investors were dominant in both sides of the market during the week. Locals accounted for 99.92percent and 92.56percent of investments and divestments respectively from the Exchange while foreign investors accounted for the balance. We expect to see less activities from foreign investors in the weeks to come due to ongoing uncertainties in the global markets. Amid the market frenzy caused by the coronavirus, Russia lit the oil house on fire on Friday after refusing to curtail production as suggested by the OPEC members. The price of oil is down 30percent since the beginning of 2020 and expected to fall further as Saudi Arabia significantly dropped oil prices during the weekend, while propping up production. Money Market, Bills and Bonds The Interbank Money Market (IMM) was busier during the first week of March, reversing the downtrend experienced throughout February. The total value of transactions during the week totaled to 86.1bn/-(37.42m US dollar), 74percent up compared to 49.5bn/- (21.52m US dollar) during the previous week. The interbank rate dived by 64bps to close the week at 3.86percent. Investors’ appetite on Treasury bills went down during an auction held on March 4, 2020 after the 35 days tenor was undersubscribed by 50percent in one bid while the 91 days and 182 days tenors received no bids. As usual, the 364 days tenor received the most attention, receiving 80 bids out of a total of 81 bids for the whole auction. The 364 days tenor was oversubscribed by 4.58percent. The total offer size from the Bank of Tanzania was the usual 107.2bn/- ($46.59mln) while the public tendered 0.5percent less from the offer. The tender size totaled to 106.65bn/- ($46.36mln) from 81 bids. The Bank of Tanzania accepted 65 bids worth 98.3bn/- ($42.73mln). The successful amount was 7.83percent lower than the tender size, deliberately to limit the cost of capital to the government. In that sense, the total weighted average yield to maturity (WAYTM) lowered by 16bps to 5.47percent while maintaining the deceleration for a third week in a row. Currency Market The shilling maintained strength as it gained back 8 pips, marking two consecutive weeks of appreciation. The shilling closed the week at a weighted average exchange rate of TZS 2,300.67/ USD compared to TZS 2,300.75/ USD during the previous week. Fundamentals support a strong shilling against the greenback. According to the Bank of Tanzania Monthly Economic Review for January 2020, balance of payment surplus grew 25percent month to month, to a net 699.6m US dollar. Foreign reserves were maintained at 5.5bn US dollar, enough to cover 6.4 months of imports. Under different circumstances, strengthening global prices of gold and plummeting oil would be amusing for the shilling, but the uncertainties brought by the novel coronavirus limit celebrations. The total amount traded in the Interbank Foreign Exchange Market (IFEM) fell by 14.7percent during the first week of March, to a total of 24m US dollar compared to 28.15m US dollar during the last week of February. The amount is still substantially high compared to other weeks of 2020.
