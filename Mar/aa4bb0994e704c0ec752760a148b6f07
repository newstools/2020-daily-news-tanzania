TANZANIAN film makers have been asked to produce innovative films which have positive lessons to the young generation and enable them to preserve culture that now faces globalization challenges. The call was made over the weekend by the Deputy Minister of Information, Culture, Arts and Sports, Juliana Shonza during the inauguration of Dalton Film whose theme inspires youth to study hard so as to do well in classes. She said that it was discouraging to find that many films do not have positive teachings to the youth, something she called dangerous to them. “It is the responsibility for parents, guardians and teachers to ensure that we prepare disciplined youth in our society because the society that does not have value its culture is a dead one,” said Shonza. Shonza said that inauguration of the film which has positive teaching to the youths gives a good message to the local artistes and challenges them to be creative when producing works which can help the nation to care the youth. Shonza said Tanzania produces about 800 to 1,500 films per year, but only a few of them have positive messages to impart to young generation. The producer of Dalton Film, Daud Cherriet said that the message in his film is about using some of the available challenges to be someone’s opportunity. He further said that a student from a poor family can make a better achievement in education than those from wealthy families. Adding, he said that the film he produced intends to inform people that someone is not supposed to be satisfied by the level of education he has attained, but he is obliged to do more efforts to achieve a higher level. “This attitude will make our students to work hard and understand that being in a good level does not require a person to get satisfied with the achievement he has, but it is a chance to do more,” said Cherriet.
