SOME primary schools in the city will benefit from a donation of 1,000 desks from the Rotary Club of Dar es Salaam. The club on Sunday embarked on fundraising for buying the desks to improve primary school’s teaching and learning environment in the city. Some primary schools still face a shortage of desks following the parents’ response to send their children to school, thanks to the government’s free education policy. The policy, which the fifth phase government started implementing three years ago, has brought relief to parents since they no longer pay school fees (from Form 1-4) for their children. Since then, the schools have experienced an increase in the number of enrollment. The Rotary Club of Dar es Salaam has targeted to provide 1,000 desks to primary schools starting with those in dire need in Ilala District. Speaking in Dar es Salaam, Rotary Club of Dar es Salaam President Abdulqadir Abdulhameed said the club was on the course to raise funds from well-wishers and other Rotary Clubs in and outside the country for a thousand desks. As a start, he explained, the club had organised a series of fund raising activities, including a talent show dubbed ‘Rotary Got Talents’ that was recently held in the city. “It was a very successful event. The turnout was great too. We had fun, but at the same time joined our hands for this noble cause,” he said adding: “We thank all the other Rotary Clubs in and outside the country for supporting us together with all the sponsors who made the event the success it was.”
