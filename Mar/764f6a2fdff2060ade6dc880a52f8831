HEALTH Minister, Hamad Rashid Mohammed has received hospital equipment, including beds and mattresses donated by members of ‘Zanzibar- Canada Diaspora Association (ZCADIA)’ with a call on other people living abroad to help equip hospitals here. “We thank you so much for the donation. The government is doing what it can to improve health facilities, but we still need support from stakeholders like the diaspora,” Mohamed said at the event held in the State House. He said the equipment will be distributed to hospitals in Unguja and Pemba islands at this time when the world is in grief over the spread of coronavirus, which has already left thousands dead. According to a press release from State House, the consignment was handed over to the Health Minister by the Deputy Permanent Secretary, Mr Salum Kassim Ali, who emphasized that the government was happy with the diaspora. The quantity and cost of the equipment was not revealed.
