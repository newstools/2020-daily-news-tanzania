STRENGTHENING relationship between Media and Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) is being encouraged for the country to achieve its development goals. This was an important message delivered at the ‘Media/ CSOs engagement training’ which aimed at bridging the existing gap in collaboration between the two. Facilitators Mr Ali Mwandini from ‘Internews,’ and a senior journalist, Ms Hawra Shamte said at the training that although both the CSOs and the media play an important role in servicing the people and link them between the government and members of the public, their relation has not been smooth. “We see that there is a communication gap between CSOs and the media, this gap should be narrowed,” Ms Shamte said at the training organised by the Association of Non-Governmental Organisations in Zanzibar (ANGOZA) with support from USAID, ‘Internews,’ and ‘fhi360.’ During the training held here, representatives from CSOs raised their concerns, claiming that journalists and media were biased and their coverage gives bigger space to prominent figures during events, as some reporters also either distort information or the published stories lack objectivity. Journalists also appealed to CSOs to strengthen relations by being transparent and provide relevant information that is asked by them. “We still have a problem of getting information from CSO executives. Some are afraid and are reluctant to reply to questions from the media."
