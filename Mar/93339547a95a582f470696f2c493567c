THE Public Accounts Committee (PAC) has hailed Benjamin Mkapa Hospital (BMH) as a model health facility in the country for the provision of high quality health services. PAC Chairman Allan Kiula heaped the praises on the 400-bed hospital during a recent PAC tour of BMH, noting that the healthcare system at the public hospital was of high quality. “I want the hospital management to convey our gratitude to all medical staff at the health facility for high quality health services,” the PAC chairman told the management while winding up the tour of BMH. Mr Kiula expressed satisfaction with the government’s heavy investment to set up BMH, advising the government to repay the loan used to fund the construction of the hospital. He pointed out by repaying the loan amounting to 123bn/-to the National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF) would help the hospital focus on the provision of health services. For his part, BMH Executive Director, Dr Alphonce Chandika, said so far the hospital had served 277, 963 patients since its establishment in 2015, saying the hospital was equipped with state-of-the art equipment. He mentioned some modern equipment at the hospital as Mammography, CT Scan, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Cath lab, a health facility with diagnostic imaging equipment used to visualize the arteries of the heart and the use of chambers of the heart. “The Cath lab has served at least 141 patients serving 2.1bn/- which would been used by the government to refer the patients to overseas hospitals,” he said. Dr Chandika further noted that the BMH also served as a teaching hospital for students undertaking medical studies at the University of Dodoma (Udom) and a research centre in which the hospital teamed up with the National Institute for Medical Research (NIMR). “The hospital’s research centre teams up with NIMR to conduct medical research projects,” he observed.
