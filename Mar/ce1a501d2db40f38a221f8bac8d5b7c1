TANZANIA Chamber of Commerce, Industry, and Agriculture (TCCIA) has commended NBC bank for its effort to improve international business in the region. This was said during the launch of NBC Business Club in Mtwara Region recently. TCCIA chairman in Mtwara, Swallah Saidi acknowledging the banks effort to spearhead their ambitions to reach nearby countries, urging businesspersons and investors to make use of these clubs to ensure they promote their business and invite fellow partners to engage in the clubs activities for coordination and networking to reach their goals. “We started the business with Comoros in a very short period of time and TCCIA has been coordinating trade agreements between Comoros and Mtwara, but there are some who started trading after the landing. Subsequently, ships began to decline after the awakening in that opportunity. It is my hope that through the NBC business Club, opportunities like this will grasped,” he said. Mr Swallah advised people to invest more in the region taking into account of the benefits from different opportunities that are in the region such as the cross-border businesses known as cross border trade. On the other hand, Acting Business Officer from Mtwara Region, Mr Amani Lusaki, praised NBC for introducing Business club which has brought together different businesses to motivate, educate and inform them about different business opportunities. NBC’s Head of Product and Financial Services Headquarters Dar es Salaam, Mr Jonathan Bitababaje said business club is used as part of business management and customer loyalty strategy with the purpose of providing non-financial support services through business skills training and capacity building for NBC business clients. “We provide them with in-house training and also provide them with exports to meet larger and larger businesses so that they can import products and get directly from the industry,” he added.
