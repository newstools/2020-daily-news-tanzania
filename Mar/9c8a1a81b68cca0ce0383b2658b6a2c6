TANZANIANS returning home from Mombasa, Kenya have been asked to use a special port in Micheweni area where they will be screened for coronavirus before they socialise with the local population. It is said that following the coronavirus outbreak, many people from Pemba who were living in Mombasa are returning home from a country with increasing number of coronavirus cases. “We need your support to curb coronavirus just by adhering to the directives, which indicates that you have to pass through the special entry,” said Ms Salama Mbarouk Khatib- District Commissioner (DC) for Micheweni. Talking to the people in the coastal villages of Tondooni and Makangale, she said everyone in the country, including Zanzibaris returning from Mombasa-Kenya should take the war against coronavirus seriously to remain safe. The DC warned that the government will take stern action against people returning home but fail to follow the directives intended to protect people from coronavirus. People of Mombasa and north Pemba have close ties, mixing and living freely on both sides for decades, including inter-marrying, fishing, and engaging in trade.
