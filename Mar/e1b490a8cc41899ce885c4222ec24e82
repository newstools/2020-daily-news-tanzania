A NON-GOVERNMENTAL Organisation- John Snow Inc (JSI) has donated records keeping equipment to Dodoma City Council’s Social Welfare Department to improve their efficiency. Speaking in an event to hand over the donations here recently, Director of JSI, Mr Anthony Mwendamaka, said that the goal of the Research and Training Institute was to enhance social welfare and provision of health services. “We have handed over office furniture including 17 cupboards to be used for documents’ keeping,” said the JSI Director while presenting them to City Director representative, Dr Joseph Mdachi. Mr Mwendamaka said that the donation would help to uplift the level of efficiency in keeping records of children living in vulnerable conditions, adding that the equipment would help to keep records from Ward to District levels. However, he noted that it was the duty of JSI as a stakeholder to support the government’s commitment in providing accessible, high quality health and social services to vulnerable groups and to promote improved health equity. “The programme is working to build the size, quality and sustainability of the community health worker and social service worker cadres and the systems, which support them,” he said. On his part, Dr Joseph Mdachi, who represented City Director Godwin Kunambi, expressed gratitude to JSI for the donation, and urged other health stakeholders to emulate the Institute. “I should convey my gratitude to JSI for great contribution to Social Welfare thus improving health services provision,” he said. The event was witnessed by Head of Social Welfare Department at Dodoma City Council, Ms Rebecca Ndaki, and Social Welfare Officers at district levels.
