ZANZIBAR yesterday joined the rest of the World to mark the International Women’s Day, with admirable record in overcoming challenges which impede the development of women in the archipelago. Taking part at the Women Day Forum held at the ‘Sheikh Idrissa Abdulwakili Memorial Hall’, officers from the government, State University of Zanzibar (SUZA), women groups, students, Journalists, and UN officers commended the government for the good job so far in promoting women’s rights. “While we appreciate the commitment that has been shown by the Zanzibar government in realising the goals (SDGs- 2030, Beijing recommendations), we at UN are proud to be part of the changes for women better life,” said Ms Julia Browsaro- UN Women Deputy Representative in the country. She said since the Beijing conference, 25 years ago, which set up goals to be achieved to make the lives of women better, Zanzibar has recorded positive changes in health sector, education, empowerment, political participation, and prevention of violence against women and girls. “The UN reaffirms its commitment as a strong dependable partner in promoting gender Equality and ending all forms of discrimination and Violence against Women and Girls,” the UN Rep reaffirmed. The Minister for Labour, Empowerment, Elderly, Children and Women Dr Maudline Cyrus Castico informed the forum that although Zanzibar boasts of achievement in implementing the Beijing Platform for Action a more robust response to challenges, was needed. She mentioned violence against women and children; poverty among women; lack of access to resources and land; gender inequality; physical, sexual and emotional violence as issues that require concerted efforts to end. Ms Mgeni Hassan Juma, Deputy Speaker of the Zanzibar House of Representatives, graced the event calling on men to show commitment in ensuring gender equality in areas of development and that Zanzibar and other parts of the country are better place for women and children. The International theme for Women’s Day- 2020 is “I am Generation Equality: Realising Women’s Rights,” and at least four papers: ‘Women and Education’, ‘Women and Health,’ ‘Women and economic Empowerment,’ and ‘Violence against women,’ were presented at the celebration forum.
