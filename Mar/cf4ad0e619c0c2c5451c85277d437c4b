MEMBERS of the public have been urged to protect water infrastructure countrywide as the government invests a lot of shillings to ensure its people get reliable clean and safe water supply. The government has also committed itself to continuing with the allocation of funds in different regions to address water challenges. Speaking to residents of Mdawi, Kimochi, Minister for Water, Prof Makame Mbarawa, said water projects needed to be protected for sustainable access to water supply. He was inspecting the ongoing water project implementation. “This project is heavily funded by the government and is meant to curb a shortage of water in this area which has been the main concern for you and the government. What you should do now is to make sure you protect its infrastructure,” he said. Prof Mbarawa hailed Mdawi Village leaders for mobilising villagers who he said had played a big role in the ongoing water project implementation. Briefing the minister, Acting Managing Director with Moshi Urban Water Supply and Sanitation Authority (Muwsa), which is implementing the project, Mr Aron Joseph, said the project cost 101m/-. “The project is expected to benefit more than 3,000 villagers who have been facing a shortage of water for decades,” he said. Mdawi Village Executive Officer (VEO) Lazaro Kimaryo thanked the government for implementing the project which he said would end their long time challenge of water scarcity. “We have been waiting for such a project for many years. The water problem we have is unexplained. We pay between 500/- and 700/- for a 20-litre can of water. This is expensive, taking into account that the number of litres of water a household may use a day,” he said.
