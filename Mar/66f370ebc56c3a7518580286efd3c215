A FEW days after President Dr John Magufuli cautioned and gave advice on the Coronavirus, some religious sects in Kilimanjaro Region, have begun to implement his call. A follow up by the ‘Daily News’ in several Churches in the region revealed steps, where the Clergy reinforced abstinence from handshaking to hand waves during their proceedings and other services. In a Hoy Mass held on Sunday at the Christ the King Cathedral-Catholic Diocese of Moshi, to mark the Third Sunday of the Lent Period, the Presiding Priest during the Mass Rev. Richard Asenga, skipped the traditional handshake as a sign of peace that has been part of the Catholic Mass proceedings. Likewise in a Sunday service held at the Moshi Township Parish of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Tanzania (ELCT), the worshipers were also notified of the alert issued by Government through President Dr John Magufuli. During his sermon, Rev Leons Shirima urged his believers and the general public to take precautionary measures against the disease that is currently a global epidemic. “Mr President Dr John Magufuli, has already given a national alert; We have to heed the President’s alert and message as well as directives right to the Church Headquarters. This has been instructed that we bring to you, please do not ignore these directives”, he appealed, adding that people should avoid the ailment at all costs. However, he urged them to continue worshiping God to prevent the disease from entering the country as it is witnessed in some places, where it has claimed lives. Recently, President Magufuli raised an alert message and urged Tanzanians to take precautions against the disease, saying that religious leaders should take the lead by educating and creating awareness in their places of worship.
