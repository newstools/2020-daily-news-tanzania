THREE people were on Friday arraigned before the Kisutu Resident Magistratesâ€™ Court in Dar es Salaam charged with three counts of trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, including heroine and bhang. They are Charles Mgonella, Innocent Wanna and Collin Mgonella. The accused were not allowed to enter any plea to the charges before Senior Resident Magistrate Augustina Mbando because they fall under the Economic and Organised Act. They were remanded because the court lacked jurisdiction to entertain anything, including the question of bail. Magistrate Mbando adjourned the case until April 2, 2020 for mention, as investigation into the matter, according to the prosecution, is incomplete. The prosecution told the court that the accused committed the offences on February 27, 2020 in Kiwalani Migombani, Ilala District. On the same day and place, the prosecution alleged, jointly and together, all accused were found trafficking in 145.76grams of heroin, which was a narcotic drug. Charles, according to the prosecution, was also found alone trafficking in 95.09grams of bhang. The prosecution alleged further that on the same day and place in Ilala District in the city of Dar es Salaam Charles was found alone trafficking psychotropic substances known as delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol, weighing 20.24grams
