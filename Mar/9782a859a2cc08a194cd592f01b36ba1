MO Dewji Foundation has donated 100m/-to Tumaini La Maisha (TLM), an NGO working in partnership with Muhimbili National Hospital to provide care and treatment for children with cancer in Tanzania. The donation is part of the Foundation’s annual commitment to improving the wellbeing of children. The National Children’s Oncology Centre at MNH is the first children’s cancer ward in all of Tanzania. TLM began with the simple, but ambitious task of ensuring patients at the children’s ward received the highest-possible quality of care of which treatment was provided free of charge. A press statement issued on Friday by the Foundation stated that since Mr Mohammed Dewji first visited the centre in 2015, he pledged an annual contribution to improve the efforts to cover costs of supplies and medicine, including new equipment, but also to support the clinic programme. TLM’s mission is that all children with cancer in Tanzania have access to quality services leading to cure rates seen in resource rich settings, which means no child in Tanzania suffers or dies from cancer. “TLM offers all care and treatment free to children living with cancer throughout the country, as well as providing for their transport to and from the hospital. TLM Tanzania was registered in November 2011 in Tanzania. The team has since grown from a single room at ORCI to being based at MNH with eight partner centres nationwide,” reads part of the statement. It added that Mo Dewji Foundation would continue its support of Tumaini La Maisha and promote others to do the same. “We believe strengthening the healthcare system will help improve life conditions of Tanzanians.”
