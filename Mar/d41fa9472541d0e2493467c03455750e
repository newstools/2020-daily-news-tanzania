A LONG-serving gender activist, Mary Rusimbi has credited changes in the country’s laws and policies that have seen more women in politics and decision making bodies. Her remarks came in line with celebrations to mark the International Women’s Day on 8th March. She said the government made many changes in laws and policies that have enabled a number of women get into decision making bodies. Ms Rusimbi however pointed an accusing finger at political parties, saying they were a big challenge towards a smooth path for women in political leadership. “Political parties have been gatekeepers. Through internal elections or policies, political parties have been denying opportunities to women to take leadership roles,” she said. She was speaking during an event held on Monday evening at the Aga Khan Medical University (AKU) in Dar es Salaam to mark the International Women’s Day. On his part, Prof Joe Lugalla, Academic Head, School of Nursing and Midwifery at the Aga Khan University, commented that since empowering women was a long-time movement, there have been a number of laws to empower the group. Women themselves were at the forefront of fighting for their rights, and there were many leaders who fought to ensure that women are empowered. “It was crucial to empower women, considering their contribution to the development of the society and country in general. Their contribution had to be recognized,” he said, adding: “Empowering woman means empowering the society, because women are the ones who take care of families.” He said to mark the Women International Day, the AKU engaged in weeklong social activities.
