MISUNGWI District Council in Mwanza Region has hailed Amref Health Africa- Tanzania for improving the wellbeing of women and girls through improved sexual and reproductive health. District Commissioner (DC), Juma Sweda in a speech read on his behalf by District Administrative Secretary (DAS), Petro Sabato during the commemoration of International Women’s Day held in Usagara Ward said the organisation’s work in the area was worthy praising. The district boss said he was aware of development projects implemented by Amref Health Africa-Tanzania through ‘Ustawi wa Mwanamke Project’ in his district which enabled residents in the district to access health services. “We thank Amref Health Africa-Tanzania for support especially in district because health services have been greatly improved,” he said. Mr Sweda noted that as regards education, the organisation had supported schools in his district to establish a special campaign to end early marriage and pregnancy and enable most of the schoolgirls and boys to pursue their studies without any problems. Giving an example, the DC said the number of school dropouts had dropped by 40 per cent in three years which showed that there were strides in education performance in the district. For his part, Misungwi District Council Chairman, Anthony Maselle besides praising the organisation requested more support to the health sector, saying the district still needed more health facilities, especially for women and children. Ustawi wa Mwanamke Project Manager, Elia Msegu thanked the government in Misungwi District for supporting him in the implementation of various development projects, adding that the project was implemented in Misungwi and Sengerema as well as in Itilima District in Mwanza and Simiyu Region.
