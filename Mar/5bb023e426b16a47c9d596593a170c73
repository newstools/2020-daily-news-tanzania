TANZANIA Cricket Association (TCA) has committed to refine cricket grounds, which will enable a good flow of leagues from junior, women, and senior level, once the coronavirus outbreak is conquered. This commitment has been made after all cricket activities were suspended by TCA management, following the Prime Minister Kassim Majaliwa’s order to ban all sports activities and events that are of a huge public nature, as part of strengthening preventive measures to avoid the spread of COVID-19. TCA Communication Officer, Atif Salim confirmed to the ‘Sunday News’ that they are currently upgrading the venues. “Currently we have already begun repair jobs in Tanga’s Annadil Burhani and Usagara grounds. In Morogoro, we are repairing the SUA cricket ground and it’s nearly complete.” “In Dar es Salaam, work is going on in Gymkhana and Leaders Club grounds and since cricket has been stopped we are going to go ahead with our plans of doing minor repairing for University of Dar es Salaam and Annadil Burhani grounds,” he said. Salim added; “On the cricket front, yes! We have been hit hard as a new management as this halts our process of rejuvenating cricket in Tanzania. “However, sometimes things of this nature are also a blessing in disguise as this period will give us time in preparing the grounds and with more grounds available once we have overcame the outbreak... there will be a good flow of leagues from junior, women and senior level,” he said.
