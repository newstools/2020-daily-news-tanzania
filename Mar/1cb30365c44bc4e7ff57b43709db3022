NATIONAL basketball team member Sudi Ulanga said he will have to wait longer, before starting to service again his Ugandan new, UCU Canons at the Uganda National Basketball (NBL). Ulanga recently expressed his desire to continue carrying on his professional career in Uganda before going back to his former club UCU Canons early this month. Speaking to the ‘Daily News’ from Uganda early this week, Ulanga confirmed that the league that was due to kicks off last Friday has been postponed. He said that the postponement of the league serves as one of the preventive measures taken by the East African Community (EAC) member nations to protect people against pandemic Covid-19. “The league was supposed to start on Friday, but organisers have decided to postpone it until further notice,” he said. Ulanga added that was expecting to enter on the court this Sunday for his first match with UCU Canons who were scheduled to face KIU Titans, the club he served last year. “I was due to kick off the new league season with my new team this Sunday, I was well prepared for the game, but things didn’t go as planned,” he said. However, he said he will continue training hard to be fit and ready for the kicks off when things turn to normal. Ulanga also wished all sportsmen and women who have been diagnosed with Covid-19 a speedy recovery and win the battle against pandemic virus. He said he has been doing well in Uganda after landing on a two-year contract with UCU Canons. The shooting guard says that he is looking for new challenge after the end of his service with KIU Titans. Ulanga, regarded by many as the best shooter to have graced the NBL, was released by KIU Titans last season. He helped the Titans to reach NLB finals in 2017 when they lost to City Oilers.
