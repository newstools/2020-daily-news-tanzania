THE coaching course that was scheduled to be conducted in Zanzibar early next month faces further postponement due to the threat of coronavirus. The Isles football governing body (ZFF) last week announced a plan to conduct the basic and intermediate courses from April 1st to 12th   in Unguja West District of Zanzibar. According to the organisers, the regional technical committee, basic coaching course was planned to start from April 1st to 12th while the intermediate course was scheduled to start from April 8th to 21st at Amaan Stadium in Unguja. There is a growing fear that the course won’t take place by April 1st as the country will be still in campaign to curb the spread of coronavirus as it was announced by the Prime Minister Kassim Majaliwa on March 15th this year. The government, through the PM banned all forms of public gatherings, including sports and called on the public to observe caution. PM Majaliwa said government had taken steps to suspend sports political gatherings and rallies for 30 days, which mathematically ends on April 15th depending on the situation. Among the most affected events include the Vodacom Premier League and all inter school games throughout the country. According to the secretary general of the technical committee, Ibrahim Makeresa, 90 coaches are expected to attend the course. He said 60 of them will attend basic coaching while 30 others are enrolled for the intermediate course. He said the basic coaching course would be conducted by Iddi Mohamed Ali while Nasra Juma Mohamed would conduct the intermediate course.
