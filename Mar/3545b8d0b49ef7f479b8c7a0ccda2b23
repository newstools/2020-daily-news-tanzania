This is equivalent to a 20.3-per cent drop,” he said. Mr Boaz explained that peace is crucial for national and individual development, urging members of the public to cooperate with the police to maintain peace in the country. “The state of the crime in the country keeps decreasing. We call on members of the public to continue cooperating with the police to maintain peace,” he said. The DCI used the occasion to urge every member of the public to take precautions against the coronavirus pandemic (Covid-19). “Let us not make fun of this disease. Every person should take precautions. This is a serious disease,” he concluded.
