MOSHI based Jaffery Charitable Medical Services (JCMS) in Kilimanjaro Region, provided free diabetes and high blood pressure testing to 600 aged people last year. This was revealed recently by Dr Baraka John of JCMS, who said the move by the health institution aimed at ensuring senior citizens have access to good health checkups, especially for non-communicable diseases, and to ensure that those who are diagnosed were subject to treatment. “We made a call concerning the free clinical checkups for the aged, and the response was good, because 600 senior citizens responded, and those who were diagnosed received treatment and drug prescriptions,” he said. In another development, JCMS has introduced a Fast track health services, which Dr John said are coordinated by the National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF), where according to him, patients could set an appointment with the institution’s medical practitioners on a suitable time chosen by the former (patient). “The Fast Track service provides health services to JCMS patients, especially those who are very busy, where they could undergo tests and receive results and medication prescriptions through means proposed by the patient,” he said. Dr John added that during this year’s Valentine Day celebrations, the institution provided free testing services, a move which he said was meant to raise awareness of its available medical services to the community which they work in. One of the beneficiaries of the free clinical checkups for the aged, Ms Rose Meela (67) from Majengo area within Moshi municipality, thanked JCMS for putting special consideration to the aged in the country.
