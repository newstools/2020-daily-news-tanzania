GWAMBINA FC have intensified their race to earn top flight league promotion next season as they sit ten points clear in their group B of the First Division League (FDL) with 37 points after 17 outings. The Misungwi based side look certain to climb into the elite league and be among the fresh teams to cause trouble bearing in mind that their performance in the unfolding FDL has been impressive. However, much resistance is seen in group A of FDL where two teams Dodoma FC and Ihefu FC fight neck to neck with both sides tying on 36 points after 17 encounters each. The former leads the ladder courtesy of having a superior goal difference. After Gwambina FC, on second place in group B are Geita Gold with 27 points, while Arusha FC, Mashujaa FC and Transit Camp occupies third, fourth and fifth places with 25, 23 and 22 points respectively. The going seems tough for Gipco FC, Pamba SC, Mawenzi Market and Stand United, who from 17 games, they have attained 22, 22, 21 and 20 points in that order, whereas Rhino Rangers, Sahare Stars and Green Warriors finish up the last three places with 19, 19 and 18 points in that order. In group A, the third place is accommodated by Mbeya Kwanza, who have 31 points and still have a chance to get promoted into the top flight provided they win their remaining encounters and hope the two league toppers lose their matches. Occupying fourth, fifth and sixth places are Majimaji FC, Njombe and Friends Rangers with 31, 26 and 24 points, while African Lyon, Boma FC and Cosmopolitan have bagged 24, 22 and 16 points apiece. The last three slots are filled by Pan African, Iringa United and Mlale FC as they have pocketed 13, 12 and 11 points collectively after playing 17 games each. This season, four teams in the Mainland Premier League will automatically be relegated, while the fate of other two teams will be decided via playoffs since from next season, the league will trade with 18 teams.
