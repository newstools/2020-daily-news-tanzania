BENJAMIN Mkapa Hospital (BMH) will today conduct screening and diagnosis of hearing loss to pupils of Ng’ong’ona Primary School in Ng’ong’ona Ward, Dodoma City, as part of marking World Hearing Day. According to a press statement released yesterday by BMH Communications and Public Relations Unit, the hospital through its Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) Department will conduct the exercise. “The hospital will conduct screening of hearing loss to pupils and those who will be found with serious hearing problems will be referred to hospital for medication,” reads part of the statement. Under the theme “Hearing for Life”, this year’s annual event will be used by BMH’s ENT Department to raise public awareness on how to prevent ear from hearing loss to pupils of the Ng’ong’ona Primary School. The statement points out that the selection of the theme by the World Health Organisation (WHO) expresses a key message that timely and effective interventions can ensure people with hearing loss are able to achieve their full potential. World Hearing Day is a campaign held each year by Office of Prevention of Blindness and Deafness of the WHO. Activities take place across the world and the event is hosted by the WHO today. The campaign’s objectives are to share information and promote actions towards the prevention of hearing loss and improved hearing care. The first event was held in 2007. Before 2016, it was known as International Ear Care Day
