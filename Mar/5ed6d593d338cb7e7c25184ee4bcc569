The charges relating to inversion at Segerea Remand Prison include disobedience of lawful order, unlawful assembly, malicious damage to property, using abusive language to prison officers and assault. Before Principal Resident Magistrate Huruma Shaidi, all accused persons denied the charges, which are alleged to have been committed March 13,2020 at Segerea Prison in Ilala District in the city. The accused have been charged alongside 13 others who are still at large. They are alleged to have committed the offences when they went to receive the party's national Chairman Freeman Mbowe who was released from prison on that day after paying 70m/-fine upon conviction in another criminal case he was facing before the same court.
