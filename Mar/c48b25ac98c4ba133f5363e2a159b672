HIGH Court Judge Lucia Kairo has commended Tanzania Network of Legal Aid Providers (Tanlap) for taking a holistic approach to empower women through legal aid. She noted that older women were still persecuted and accused of witchcraft. “However, the reasons behind accusations were complex: poverty, disease, age discrimination and land disputes are all factors. Usually, it is the most marginalised who are accused, as they are least able to defend themselves,” she said. Expounding, she said most of the cases pending in court related to inheritance where widows were denied the right to inherit land and other properties after the death of the husband. “Tanlap has been the staunch advocate of access to justice among the poor and marginalised in Tanzania. This should be emulated,” she said. Tanlap was established following the realisation of the need to have an active and independent network of legal aid providers to build the capacity of legal aid providers, to harmonise legal aid services and ethical conduct of legal aid providers and to have a collective forum for participation in policy and law reforms. International Women’s Day (IWD) was marked on March 8 with its focal point on women’s rights, particularly gender equality, which is reflected in this year’s theme: I am Generation Equality: Realising Women’s Rights. IWD was marked at national level in Simiyu Region where the guest of honour was Vice-President Samia Suluhu Hassan. Ms Suluhu Hassan’s speech highlighted the areas the government had done something to empower women in education, healthcare, decision-making processes, women’s rights and the fight against gender-based violence and poverty eradication.
