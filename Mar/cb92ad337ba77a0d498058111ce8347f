FEAR of the unknown, social challenges, environment, and lack of confidence among women has been mentioned as barriers towards gender equality promotion, stakeholders have revealed. They made the revelation in Dar es Salaam during the ‘Ring the Bell for Gender Equality’ meeting, organised by the Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange (DSE) in partnership with UN Women, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP and UN Global Compact, among other partners. “Most women are also reluctant to make decisions even if they are in a better position to do so. However, as heads of institutions, we have been trying our best to promote them despite all those challenges,” said CRDB Bank Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Abdulmajid Nsekela. He said that gender balance promotion in the bank is now at 44 percent, and that it has been among the most prioritised agenda in the institution, so as to achieve 50 percent in the near future. He added that the bank keeps on coming up with various approaches, not only for gender equality purposes but also for grooming and creating best women leaders. UN Women Representative, Ms Hodan Addou said that research has repeatedly confirmed that investing in gender equality will have a multiplier effect and benefit not just to the family and the community, but the entire nation. Yet, even though evidence shows women in managerial and leadership positions are 15 percent more likely to perform better in business, globally, only 29 percent of senior management roles are held by women, with some of the lowest proportions of women in management found in Sub- Saharan Africa, she said, adding that: “The higher you go in the organizational hierarchy, the fewer the women get, with only 3.9 percent of CEO positions held by women, and a recent study by the McKinsey Global Institute has shown that there is a significant gap between women at the entry level and women in management.”
