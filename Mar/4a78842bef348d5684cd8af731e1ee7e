Tanzania Securities said in weekly market blast yesterday that DSEI was mainly pushed by cross-listed stocks from NSE. “This is mainly due to share price drop of cross listed stock especially those listed in NSE,” the weekly report said.

Orbit Securities Head of Market and Analytics, Imani Muhingo earlier said DSE market being more than 85 per cent foreign driven, was already affected following the global financial markets meltdown. “I believe our turning point was when an isolated case was registered in the US, because this is when alarm bells rang for global investors,” Mr Muhingo said. He said going forward was expected to be a dull market in the next few weeks or months until corona is containable and its impact fully assessed. “We may have some few sizeable off-market transactions but the general view is still gloomy,” Mr Muhingo said.
