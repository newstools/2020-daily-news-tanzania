We are doing this basically to support the government efforts in building an industrial economy.President John Magufuli’s administration has embraced industrialization as part of the panacea for unemployment among the youths because industrialization drive was expected to be one of the significant remedies by creating thousands of job opportunities across the country, “he said. He noted that without an efficient industrial base, the country’s economy can hardly develop and create job opportunities. Industries have great potential of creating jobs and attracting capital, skills and knowledge…industrialization is the way to prosperity…national development cannot be imported, it must come from within, he said.
