THE Prevention and Combating of Corruption Bureau in Dodoma Region has collected about 97.43m/-in outstanding debts from 53 members of the Savings and Credit Cooperative Societies (SACCOS) in Majengo and Mipango Sokoni areas respectively. Addressing a news conference here on Thursday, PCCB Regional Commander, Sosthenes Kibwengo said the money was obtained after the corruption watchdog arrested SACCOS members who have accumulated debts for many years. Mr Kibwengo said PCCB made a follow up on the loans to ensure that all the debts were paid after realising that many of them had been accumulated for many years. “We are equally investigating some names of leaders of those SACCOS who acted against the law, thus sabotaging funds for development of the SACCOS." He said that the exercise to collect the money was still ongoing, asking all SACCOS leaders and members to clear their debts before facing problems. “Equally, we want to remind all SACCOS to comply with legal requirements to pay statutory taxes,’’ he insisted. Mr Kibwengo said PCCB was still holding the money but it was planning to hold talks with the registrar of SACCOS to ensure that the money was channeled to leaders who were elected legally. On SACCOS whose leaders were incompetent, he added, PCCB advised that the money be used to clear outstanding debts in loans taken by those SACCOS. The PCCB Regional Boss said his office decided to follow up the money following a directive by the government after the Ministry of Agriculture identified the presence of huge outstanding debts in SACCOS, insisting that those who took loans should repay them. “The aim of the government is to ensure that the SACCOS continue existing as well as making sure that those who obtained loans after submitting fake documents are bringing back the money,’’ he said.
