THE government has directed Watumishi Housing Company (WHC) to make sure public servants are major beneficiaries of the housing projects executed a cross the country. Deputy Minister of State in the President's Office responsible for Public Service Management and Good Governance, Dr Mary Mwanjelwa said public servants who through their contributions to pension schemes, the main shareholders in the WHC, should be given priority whenever the housing project is completed. "The WHC should give priority to public servants in all their projects countrywide to cater for the growing demand for decent houses," she said in Dar es Salaam over the weekend during the tour at Gezaulole housing project that is set to be completed early next month although some of houses are already occupied by tenants. Dr Mwanjelwa said WHC should set aside certain percentage of houses in all the housing projects that will be only for civil servants. She commended WHC for putting different categories of houses that meet the needs of public servants. She also ordered the contractor constructing infrastructure for waterÂ  supply in the new WHC houses to complete their work on time lest face penalty. "Tenants cannot enter the new houses without having reliable water supply otherwise they will be at high risk of contracting waterborne diseases," she noted. The WHC Chief Executive Officer, Dr Fred Msemwa assured deputy minister that all the government directives will be implemented to make sure that public servants benefit from housing projects. "Priority in the housing projects that are complete will be given to public servants," she said noting that employees from the private sector and other buyers are invited to buy the WHC new houses.
