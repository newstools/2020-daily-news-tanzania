IN a move to boost its academic status, the Moshi based Moshi Cooperative University (MoCU) in Kilimanjaro Region is expected to introduce two new Master’s programmes. This was revealed to the media at the weekend by MoCU Director of Research and Postgraduate Studies, Dr Mangasini Katundu. He said the move would add the number of Master’s programmes at the university to five. “The two new Master’s programmes are expected to be launched in the next academic year expected to commence in September 2020,” he noted, adding that three other programmes were in progress-a Master of Arts in Cooperative and Community Development, a Master of Arts in Procurement and Supply Management and a Master of Business Management. Dr Katundu explained that the introduction of the two new programmes would boost MoCU’s status as a centre of excellence in cooperative studies for the East African Region, while at the same time improving the image of the facility in and outside the country. “The introduction of these two new programmes also compliments the government’s intention of increasing manpower. The programmes will increase the number of professionals who will manage new industries and this is due to the fact that the government’s policy is to make Tanzania a middle- income economy through industrialisation,” he said. For his part, Head of Research and Publications, Dr Isaac Kazungu, said MoCU planned to put the facility’s journal online.
