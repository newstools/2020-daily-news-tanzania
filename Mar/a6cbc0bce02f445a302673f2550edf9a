Sudan's prime minister has survived an assassination attempt after his convoy was attacked in the capital, Khartoum. "An explosion hit as Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok's car was driving by but thank God no-one was hurt," Ali Bakhit, in the PM's office, told AFP. Mr Hamdok was appointed to head Sudan's transitional government last August, a few months after the overthrow of long-time President Omar al-Bashir. He has reportedly been moved to a safe location.
