GENDER-Based Violence (GBV) acts have declined in Regicheri Ward, Tarime District, Mara Region, according to local government officials. Speaking during this year’s International Women’s Day held in Regicheri Ward recently, Regicheri Ward Executive Officer (WEO), Meshaki Aligawesa confirmed the number of GBV had gone down in recent years, thanks to efforts made by the government in collaboration with stakeholders to end GBV. “GBV acts have declined drastically in our ward due to the formation of women and children’s protection teams at village and ward levels,” the WEO said. He called for continued sensitisation campaigns that would make Regicheri Ward and other parts of Tarime District free from GBV acts. Mr Aligawesa, who is also the chairperson of the women and children’s protection committee in the ward, also said that empowering women economically was crucial as far as the fight against GBV acts was concerned. International Women’s Day marked at the village was made possible by Tanzania Gender Networking Programme (TGNP) through knowledge centres of Regicheri and Nyakonga. Ms Monica John, a villager from Regicheri Ward, asked TGNP to consider supporting girls who had been escaping Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) during the FGM season by establishing rescue camps. FGM remains a major concern in the district where it is still practiced with district and regional authorities vowing to eradicate FGM.
