THE government has donated a new ambulance worth over 200m/- to Chalinze District Council in Coast Region to improve health services. Speaking during the handover ceremony a few days ago, Chalinze MP Ridhiwani Kikwete thanked the government for the support, saying the council was in need of another ambulance. "Our two ambulances are grounded as one was involved in an accident and the other had a mechanical breakdown. We remained with only one ambulance. Having this new ambulance, which will be handed over to Chalinze Health Centre, is a great relief," he added. He emphasised to take proper care of the vehicle, saying it had cost the government a lot of money. He noted that it was needed by residents in all five wards in the council as they were sharing one ambulance, which was difficult. In another development, Kibaoni and Msalabani villagers in Mandera Ward, Chalinze District, expect to benefit from health services from a dispensary which will be finished by June this year. Mr Ridhiwani Kikwete said 49m/-, which was released by the district council, had been spent on the project whose implementation had reached 90 per cent. He further added that 10m/- more would be added by the council so that it could be finished and start operating on time. "Our plan is to complete this dispensary and upgrade it to a health centre in the future. We have already set aside 25 acres for this purpose," he noted. Kibaoni Village Executive Officer Zuhura Ibrahim noted that the project, which started in 2016, aimed at saving Kibaoni and Msalabani villagers from walking long distances to access health services. "At the time being about 1,700 villagers and those living in Msalabani Village walk long distances to access health services in other villages, but this challenge will  be addressed soon after construction," she explained.
