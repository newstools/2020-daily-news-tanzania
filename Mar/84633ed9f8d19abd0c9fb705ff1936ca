WOMEN at the state-run utility firm—Tanzania Electric Supply Company (Tanesco) have donated over 6m/- worth foodstuffs and construction materials to Rahman Orphanage in Dodoma partly to celebrate the International Women’s Day. “With the world trekking into a ‘massive year’ of gender equality, this year’s international event held globally today is centered on generation equality,” Tanesco’s Chief Technical Adviser, Eng Sophia Mgenja, said on behalf of the corporation’s women wing, adding that it’s time for a girl child to shine and their parents to facilitate their goals. “Today, women are no longer job sensitive … we can do all sorts of work just like men,” she said. Rahman Orphanage was established in 2006 with women, who believed in promoting equal rights to the homeless and/vulnerable children in the capital city’s vicinity. But Eng Mgenja says the centre had done a remarkable duty of defusing the congestion of troubled youngsters in the streets. “We’re happy to learn that you recruit children of different age, provide shelter, food and education,” she said, adding that women must be proud. Equally, she said that employers should be at the center of promoting a free corporation environment regardless of one’s gender. Rukia Khamisi, the cofounder of the centre told the Tanesco delegates that the centre was delighted by the firm’s gesture. “We started with 12 children and today we have over 45 children at the main centre alone. The structure available can only accommodate 20 beds … recently we sought to expand the construction and that Tanesco’s support will help fast track the completion,” she said. However, Tanesco’s Tanzania Union of Industrial and Commercial Workers Women chairperson, Ms Renilda Kageuka, announced that part of the donation included roofing sheets, doors, and bags of cement, maize flour, timbers, rice, sugar, and cooking oil.
