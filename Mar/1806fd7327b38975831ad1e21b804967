THE Ministry of Natural Resources and Tourism is reaching to traders and individuals with the intention of harvesting and selling crocodile meat to apply for licence. While addressing a public rally at Kilangawana in Sumbawanga District Council yesterday, the Deputy Minister for Natural Resources and Tourism, Mr Constantine Kanyasu termed it a legal business only after one has processed a legal document(s) to engage in the trade. “We all know that the fifth phase government wants Tanzanians to enjoy their resources to generate income, and hence, we are now inviting and encouraging people to trade on crocodile meat. “I am calling upon interested parties who would wish to harvest or sell the meat to apply for a hunting licence in order to get permission in accordance with the guidelines stipulated for sale of crocodile meat. Emphasizing, Mr Kanyasu said that any applied permit must follow right procedures and vetting for one to qualify, saying that no one would be allowed to be in the business without government’s blessings. That was in his response to a question raised by a resident of the area, Ladislaus Kamanga, while appealing to the government to allow them kill the animals whose population had tripled in River Momba and threatening their lives. He said that the crocodiles were so many and mostly killing women and children going to the river to fetch water. President John Magufuli recently stressed the importance of members of public engaging in various activities, including in wildlife resources like game meat to boost their income, and in turn develop the country.
