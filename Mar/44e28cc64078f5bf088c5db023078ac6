VARIOUS stakeholders in early childhood development met in Dar es Salaam over the weekend to strategise on a new strategy that would put early learning as agenda number one in Tanzania and in African continent. Organising the conference, Ubongo Limited, the kids’ edutainment and creators of Ubongo Kids and Akili and Me series dubbed it ‘Building Brains.’ According to Ubongo’s Chief Business Officer, Ms Doreen Kessy said the conference marked the launch of Ubongo free, and digital learning toolkits’ platform. “We have a unique opportunity to reach families across Africa with mobile interactive, educational, and life changing contents. “Our edutainment platform can be leveraged to shift mindsets and behaviors of caregivers, and stakeholders towards purposeful early learning by stimulation and plays at the home and community. This equips kids with necessary numeracy, literacy and life skills. Our parentfocused program Akili Family provides parents with practical tools to use in order to improve their kids’ learning. “We are excited to bring Building Brains to the table as an added effort to drive this message to our key influencers of a child’s development strategy,” she said. The conference, she said would be conducted in both English and Swahili, and brought together diverse stakeholders in early childhood development to join forces and kick start a new movement, that would put early learning at the forefront of the development conversation in Tanzania and across Africa. Sponsored by HDIF (funded by UKAid) and Grand Challenges Canada (GCC), the two-day, bilingual event involved inspirational talks from a diverse group of innovators, policy-makers and unsung heroes of early learning. It was attended by parents, educators and development partners, tech-powered exhibitions and experiential learning stations, who cater as caregivers, and kids.
