MWANZA City Council (MCC) is implementing some mega projects of 5.8bn/- whose execution has reached 90 per cent, read part of Nyamagana District Commissioner, (DC), Dr Philis Nyimbi’s statement over the weekend. That was in his speech here while briefing Mwanza Regional Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM), Political Committee that was in a one day tour of the area to inspect development projects’ implementations in the city. The projects included construction of Nyamagana District Hospital’s Male Ward, a bricks’ factory at Buhongwa, Girls hostel at Buhongwa Secondary School and Mwanza Airport Passenger’s waiting lounge. However, Dr Nyimbi assured the members that all the projects will be completed on time to start providing social, health and economic services to the locals. Shedding light on the Male Ward project, MCC Acting Director, Dr Juma Mfanga said it was officially launched on September 9th in 2017 and would be completed by July 2020. “However, the project temporarily delayed because of a water stream snag that necessitated a renewal of drawings,” he said. Speaking at the end of the inspection, Mwanza Regional CCM Chairman, Dr Anthony Diallo, praised Mwanza Regional Commissioner (RC), Mr John Mongela, and his management team for proper supervision that quickened fast implementation of the projects.
