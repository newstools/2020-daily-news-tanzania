ABOUT 1,635 Form One students, who failed to secure places in January this year from Sumbawanga Municipality and Nkasi District in Rukwa Region have finally reported to schools. That was after the authorities threatened to arrest and prosecute parents, who would fail to take them to Schools, despite the government funding all freely for them. However, the latest statistics availed to the ‘Daily News’ by the Rukwa Regional Education Officer (REO), Mr Mathias Tilia, showed that 394 children from Kalambo District Council have yet to join Form One classes. According to Nkasi District Commissioner (DC), Mr Said Mtanda, by January this year, 1,215 students had not reported to schools. He said that with their strict follow-up finally all the 1,215 students reported to schools, where they were selected to join. The DC further explained that the defence and security committee met and directed all Education Officials in the area including Village and Ward Executive Officers to ensure that all students reported to the institutions. “The said committee issued a directive insisting that any deviant parent(s) should be arrested and prosecuted, and it was just within a week 915 students reported,” he added.
