Tikolo confirmed that he expects to have six buildup games in Z imbabwe that will sharpen the squad before the tournament begins in South Africa. After the buildup games in Z imbabwe, the national team will return home for further drills before setting off to South Africa. The Africa qualifier games will have two subregional groups, with the top two teams in each group progressing to the Regional final. Tanzania is placed in group A alongside Mozambique, Botswana, Cameroon, Sierra Leone and St.Helena, while group B teams are Uganda, Ghana, Lesotho, Malawi, Rwanda, Seychelles and eSwatini.
