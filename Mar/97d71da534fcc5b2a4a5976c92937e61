TRADERS conducting business at the Bukoba central market have been cautioned to adhere to directives issued by the Ministry for Health to avoid contracting COVID-19 disease. Chairman of Bukoba Traders’ Association (BTA), Hassan Mbailuka made the appeal as the nation intensified surveillance to control the coronavirus. “Traders should ensure that they adhere to directives by washing hands regularly using soap. They should also avoid shaking hands as a precaution against coronavirus,” he said. A spot survey made by this paper at Bukoba bus station revealed that sanitisers were available only at offices issuing tickets for buses but most of the hawkers were not aware of the exercise. The same scenario was seen at Bukoba central market where most of the petty traders had not been equipped with preventive gadgets. Mr Mbailuka said they were in the process of conducting a sensitisation seminar for the traders on how to avoid contracting the disease. Meanwhile, reports from Missenyi District said business at the Mutukula border has been paralysed after Uganda closed its borders on Monday as precaution against coronavirus. Sam Bin’Omugabi (32) who owns a retail shop at Mutukula said business has been heavily affected. “Normally we exchange goods with our counterparts from neeighbouring Masaka District. The closure of the Ugandan border has negatively affected our business. The good thing is that most of the traders are knowledgeable and conscious about the dangers posed by coronavirus,” he said. East African Community (EAC) member countries are taking drastic measures to contain the spread of the deadly coronavirus.
