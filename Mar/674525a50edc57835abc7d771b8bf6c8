THE atmosphere of joy engulfed pupils from six primary schools in Dar es Salaam recently who converged at Msimbazi Mseto ground to play Volleyball as part of implementing Play Unified, Learn Unified project being run by Special Olympics Tanzania (SOT). The lucky primary schools were Uhuru Mchanganyiko, Mjimwema, Tandika, Rutihinda, Sinza and the host school Msimbazi Mseto, whereby each team was made up of players who are intellectually challenged and their normal colleagues. In the end, Rutihinda Primary School emerged overall winners after stamping victories in all their matches played on the day, winning 3-2 in each game which amazed everyone, who came to watch the games. Morale boosting prizes were awarded to each team and their players who participated in the competition while encouraging them to continue the spirit of working together without any sort of segregation. Speaking after the games, the project Coordinator Kelvin Mwise said they are impressed to see that the objectives of the initiative are being achieved. “To a large extent, the fruits of Play Unified, Learn Unified project are realised and all the primary schools which are benefiting from it are very active,” he said.
