PERMANENT Secretary (PS) in the Ministry of Water, Prof Kitila Mkumbo, has directed Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Agency (RUWASA), to design a special programme that will facilitate and address water scarcity in all health facilities across the country. The PS gave the directive during a recent event to launch water and energy project in Ikungi district, Singida region, pointing out that the special programme was vital to end water scarcity problem in all health facilities. “Water service is vital to health facilities...all of them across the country should access water services,” said the PS while launching the project in three villages of Mtavira, Mungaa and Makotea. The project worth 861m/- which was funded by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), aims at addressing water shortage in the three Singida villages, plus generating power to rural communities. Prof Mkumbo said there were so many complaints from health facilities over scarcity or lack of water, saying a health facility is one of the most important places that should have reliable water services. He used the occasion to extend gratitude to UNDP for grant donation to end water scarcity in the villages, pointing out that previously only 41 per cent of households in Ikungi could access water services. On his part, the Project Manager, Emmanuel Nko, said at least 9,000 people now get access to water services after completion of the water project, saying UNDP came up with the idea of the project after learning of water scarcity in Mtavira, Mungaa and Mkotea villages. Mr Nko explained that presently, 45 per cent of people have access to water services after completion of the project. He said the construction work of solar powered water project with 18 water points started last June and was finalized in December 13 last year.
