LOSING to Kenya and Uganda in regional level women and youth tournaments was wakeup call that calls for enhancing the disciplines in the just landed 2020. The losses at the very end of the 2019, don’t change the reality as it has still remained the banner year for women and youth football following the teams’ success in COSAFA and CECAFA level tournaments. We say it is a wakeup call because it seems that the neighbours who were previously weaker are now coming up to challenge our stronghold. With the Tanzanian football giants Simba and Young Africans fully engaged, women soccer made a serious advancement, much of it being enhanced by Azam sponsored Women Football League. Turn of events and experience convince possible changes in 2020 taking into consideration the overall performance of the national teams at the continental level tournaments beat that of the clubs; Simba, Young Africans, Azam and KMC. We would like to remind football governing bodies, teams and players featuring in the country’s big leagues to be serious in preparing their women and youth players so that they become competitors and not just watchers of the of foreign leagues. They must be ready to challenge foreign players’ threat by demonstrating well their skills at both individual and teamwork basis. We don’t have to think much to see what the country reaped from the 2019, as the country’s performance in the COSAFA Cup, CECAFA Women U-20, CECAFA U-20 men and Taifa Stars players who earned Tanzania a ticket to play in AFCFON finals tell it all. We would again insist the player engaged in this season to work hard for their teams and themselves as we have witnessed that football pays handsomely as an entertaining source of income. We end by reminding players and teams that the best of players of the 2019 are those who helped Tanzania win the mentioned continental and regional level tournaments. We would like also to congratulate all who made the 2019 the banner year.
