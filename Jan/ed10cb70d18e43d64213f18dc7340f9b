POLICE in Katavi Region have arrested, for the second time, Mirumba Village Executive Officer (VEO) at Kibaoni ward in Mlele District, Ignas Katula, for allegedly impregnating a 16-year old girl. The teen girl is in form two at Mizengo Pinda Secondary School at Kibaoni Ward. The school’s Head Master, Alicko Kaminyoge told the ‘Daily News’ in a phone interview that they knew about the girl’s pregnancy after she underwent pregnancy test at Usevya Health Center. “After the medical report was released, we reported the matter to both Kibaoni Police Station and Kibaoni Ward Executive office for further action,” added the school head. A section of Mirumba villagers said that the suspect was planning to convince the girl to abort her pregnancy to escape the wrath of law. “However, he failed in his evil plan because the girl refused to abort the pregnancy for fear of encountering health complications that can result to her death,” a source who preferred anonymity told the ‘Daily News’. The teen girl lives with her mother at Mirumba village while her biological father lives in Mpanda Town. One of the villagers who preferred anonymity said that after being informed over his daughter’s pregnancy, the father returned to Mpanda where he took her daughter to Mpanda Mirumba Police Station. The villager recounted that the suspect was apprehended and grilled by police officers at Kibaoni Police Station, and after twelve hours he was released. Efforts to reach the acting Katavi Regional Police Commander, Focus Malengo proved futile as his phone went unanswered and later switched off. However, impeccable reports from Katavi Central Police Station had it that the suspect was first arrested by police officers from Kibaoni Police Station in Mlele District on January 6 this year, where he was questioned and later released on the same allegations.
