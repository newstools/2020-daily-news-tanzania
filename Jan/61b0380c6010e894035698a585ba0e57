DEPUTY Minister of Works, Transport and Communications Atashasta Nditiye has directed the Tanzania Postal Corporation (TPC) to capitalise on digital technology to cope with the pace of the fifth phase government under President John Magufuli. Mr Nditiye asked TPC workers to embrace digital technological changes as the world was changing very fast in terms of technology. He further asked them to ensure they embraced diligence and integrity in workplace and contribute to the country’s economic growth. He praised TPC management for hardworking which had made it possible to provide dividends to the government for two consecutive years, as well rescuing it from closer supervision of the central government. Speaking at the event, Postmaster General Hassan Mwang’ombe told the deputy minister that TPC was offering its services digitally and all payments were being done through the government electronic payment gateway (GePG). Mr Mwang’ombe said that already TPC had planned to intensify its services digitally and that already it had prepared an android application service which was now in final stages of trial before it was applied. With more than 158 offices countrywide, TPC convened about 90 employees of the corporation from both Mainland Tanzania and in the Isles at a meeting where they were taken through on how best they could improve their services digitally
