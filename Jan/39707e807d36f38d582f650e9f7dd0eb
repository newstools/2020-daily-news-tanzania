THE Minister of Energy Dr Medard Kalemani has directed the Tanzania Electrical Supply Company (TANESCO) to end regular power cuts in Dar es Salaam and Coast regions by replacing worn out transmission infrastructures. Minister Kalemani gave the directive recently in Dar es Salaam after he inaugurating a new transformer which will maximize power availability meant for Dar es Salaam, Coast regions and Zanzibar and get rid of power woes which were causing losses to manufacturers and domestic customers. “The newly installed transformer will increase electricity supplied to these regions to 817 MW while the actual need is 592 MW. Use the excess to ensure that no more power supply interruptions to your customers,” he said. Therefore, TANESCO should start to renovate and replace old infrastructure for stable and uninterrupted power supply for industries and domestic customers. He emphasized that old and the worn out transmission wires, polls, transformers must be replaced on time while the seven power substations serving the area are to be receiving repairs from time to time and ensure that they function properly for they were the only stumbling-blocks for constant power supply. Earlier, TANESCO’s Transmission Senior Manager, Eng. Amosi Joasi said the installed transformer that was purchased at 13.3bn/-will promote industrial development in Coast and Dar es Salaam regions. “It will also increase revenue to TANESCO through supply of uninterrupted power by frequent cuts and low voltage” he said. The senior transmission manager went on to say that the previously experienced low voltage necessitated the national power utility to alternate power supply to the Dar and coastal region from the nearby region of Tanga and Morogoro.
