A WEEK after the Forbes Magazine declared Mohammed Dewji, commonly known as Mo, as Africa’s Youngest billionaire in six years running, the Tanzanian philanthropist on Monday this week met French President Emmanuel Macron whereby the leader of the European nation shared his vision on Anglophone Africa. The Tanzanian billionaire was granted an opportunity to meet President Macron along other Chief Executive Officers (CEO) in a special presidential dinner held at Chateau de Versailles in France during the annual Choose France summit. It happened that Mr Dewji was the only Tanzanian and East African CEO invited to the presidential dinner with President Macron, an event that attracted hundreds of executive officers. Reports from the discussions held between the CEOs and President Macron had it that Mr Dewji was one of five people in a conference room with 200 executive officers who asked the President a question in relation to his (Macron’s) strategy for Anglophone Africa. “What is your strategy for Anglophone Africa?” Mr Dewji is reported to have asked the question, bearing in mind that France typically fosters business and political relationship with her former colonies and Francophone Africa. In his enthusiastic response, President Macron replied that his strategy for Africa was not focused on Francophone countries. In his twitter account Mr Dewji wrote: "It was pleasure being hosted for a dinner with President of France, Emmanuel Macron. His honesty and witty insights on the ever changing geopolitical landscape and complexity around national sovereignty really blew me away. Very charismatic leader with foresight to move France forward.” Last week, the financial magazine Forbes , issued its new report on richest people in Africa, in which Mo Dewji maintained his position as Africa’s Youngest Billionaire worth US dollars 1.6 billion.
