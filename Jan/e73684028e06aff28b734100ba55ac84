AT least 20 coaches and referees have undergone a fiveday training which ended yesterday in Manyara Region. Organised by the Boxing Federation of Tanzania (BFT), the training aimed at creating a pool of quality coaches and referees in the country. “Similar training will be held in other regions in the country as BFT targets to attract and encourage youths to venture in amateur boxing,” said BFT Secretary General, Lukelo Willilo. He said BFT has high hopes that with these kinds of training the number of boxers will also increase and in the end bring about much needed competition for a place into the national team. Willilo said the training was conducted by instructors from BFT. The Secretary General insisted that the objective is to revive amateur boxing, which has experienced a nosedive in recent years. In fact, not a single Tanzanian boxer has so far qualified for the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games and the association is planning to send national team boxers in two qualifying events. According to Willilo, the team of eight boxers who are undergoing intensive training at the National indoor Stadium in Dar es Salaam will be trimmed to get the quality boxers, who will compete in the continental qualification event to be staged in Dakar, Senegal on February 20 to 29, 2020.
