SPEAKER of the National Assembly, Job Ndugai has announced Bunda legislator, Esther Bulaya (CHADEMA) as the new opposition Chief Whip in parliament. The announcement comes barely two weeks after the main opposition parties acting Chief Whip, Joseph Selasini tendered his resignation by writing to the leader of opposition in parliament, Freeman Mbowe after working in acting capacity without confirmation. A fortnight ago, Mr Selasini expressed his dismay over what he termed as failure by Mr Mbowe to confirm him to the House Speaker in writing so that he could be in a position to have all rights and allowances as the oppositionâ€™s Chief Whip. Mr Selasini remained on that position on behalf of former Singida East MP, Tundu Lissu whose parliamentary seat was nullified by the House Speaker for contravening parliamentary standing orders and the constitution respectively. On Tuesday, Parliament Speaker confirmed that Ms Bulaya will officially take over the roles of opposition Chief Whip, after Mr Mbowe appointed her and confirmed in a letter that was sent to the House Speaker. Before her, Mr Lissu was assuming the same roles from 2015 until September 7, 2017 when he was shot several times by unknown assailants. He has since been in Belgium where he is receiving treatment. The former Singida East Member of Parliament was stripped of his seat on June 28, 2019. He gave the reasons for stripping him of his position as absenteeism and reportedly failing to file wealth declaration forms with the National Assembly.
