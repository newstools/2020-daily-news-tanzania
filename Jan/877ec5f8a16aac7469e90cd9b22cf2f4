A Ukrainian Boeing-737 with more than 170 people on board has crashed in Iran. The Ukraine International Airlines plane crashed just after take-off from Iran's Imam Khomeini airport in Tehran, said the Fars state news agency. It was bound for the Ukrainian capital Kyiv. Ukraine's embassy in Tehran said engine failure caused the crash and there was no link to terrorism. "According to preliminary information, the plane crashed as a result of an engine failure for technical reasons. Currently, the version of a terrorist attack is ruled out," the embassy said on the Ukraine Foreign Ministry's website. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said he was cutting short a trip to Oman and flying back to Kyiv. He warned against "speculation or unchecked theories regarding the catastrophe" until official reports were ready. "My sincere condolences to the relatives and friends of all passengers and crew," he said in a statement. Some 168 passengers and nine crew members were confirmed to have been registered to fly on the aircraft, Ukraine's Prime Minister Oleksiy Honcharuk said.
