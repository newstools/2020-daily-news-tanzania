THE second Vice-President Seif Ali Iddi has said that some artistes in the country are to blame for contributing to moral decay and ruining of culture as they unethically sing and dress. “Artistes are supposed to be highly respected, but some of them lead in ruining our culture. The message in the songs and the way they dress while performing is against our culture. It is unfortunate children easily grasp and practice,” Iddi said. The Second Vice-President made the comments while talking to Ally Salehe Kiba (famous as King AliKiba), the Bongo Flava artiste who paid a courtesy call to his office, Vuga Street, Stone Town. Ambassador Iddi said that artistes are well known for entertaining, an opportunity for promoting acceptable behaviour including decent dressing among youths. “It is good if art is used to educate and promote our culture,” he said. Iddi commended the artiste for being among a few promoting Tanzania culture along with his socio responsibility by supporting youth through ‘Ali-Kiba un forgettable’ campaign, “You have been doing a good job.” In reaction to Iddi’s comments Ali Kiba said his campaign aims at promoting individual health screening and visiting higher learning institutions to encourage expected graduates to get prepared for self-employment including becoming artists.
