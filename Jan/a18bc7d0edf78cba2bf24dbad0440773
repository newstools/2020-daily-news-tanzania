INDUSTRIALISTS have been reminded to abide to the laws in the production processes so as to avoid environmental degradation and risking lives of innocent Tanzanians. The Minister in the Vice President Office (Union and Environment), Mr George Simbachawene told industrialists in Coast region that he will not hesitate to order the closure of industries, which violates the laws of the land. He said all industrial operations must adhere to the laws and principles as stipulated in the Environment Management Act 2004 and its Regulations. Speaking at the premises of Kisemvule-based Fujian Hexingwang metal industries, Mkurunga District, Mr Simbachawene said impromptu visits to industries will be on regular bases. “I promise to continue conducting impromptu visits to various industries across the country to ensure all industries that are established comply with environmental laws. We welcome and encourage establishment of new industries because that is our national goal. However, establishment of industries must be in line with EMA 2004 and its Regulations,” he emphasized. The minister visited the Fujian industry without notice following complaints from the residents in the area that the owners of the plant were not complying with the law. At the end of his visit, the minister slapped a onemonth ban on production until the owners meet all environment protection conditions to the satisfaction of the National Environmental Management Council (NEMC).
