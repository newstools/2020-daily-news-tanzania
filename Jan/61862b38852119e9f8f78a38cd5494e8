CHINESE Government has invited Tanzanian youths to go to China and get instilled on how to start, operate and make their businesses known. They will be put through thorough training so that after education they do not need to wait or rely on employment, instead employ themselves to better their lives and improve economy of the country. The Far East country is taking the move to ease the employment challenge in the country as many graduates are jobless in the streets and most of them remain waiting for the government to provide work for them while there is no enough room. Chinese Ambassador to Tanzania, Ms Wang Ke said that her government was committed to see Tanzanians so that they raise awareness, enhance their experience in their respective fields on the field as it is one of areas that could boost economic growth among individuals as well as for the country. She was speaking at Arusha while launching a Business Incubator at the Institute of Accountancy Arusha (IAA). Ms Ke said that doors are open at any time for the youth to go to China to learn, adding that many Chinese youth are engaged in their own business and are successful. She said there was no need to be desperate for government employment as posts are very limited in any country
