That was said recently by Katavi Regional PCCB acting head, Mr Faustine Mahijo while meeting regional security and defence committee members. Explaining, he thanked members of the public for closely co-operating with them by furnishing them with vital and lead information, which helped to save the amount. " The anti-corruption watchdog unearthed that some fraudulent cooperative societies in Katavi region strategized to embezzle over 90 m/-, where 30 m/- involved ghost payments to health staff allegedly conducting training to the cooperative societies’ staff on how to fight new HIV infections" he said. On his part the Katavi Regional Commissioner (RC) Mr Juma Homela commended the PCCB for the splendid work and urged them to intensify their work without fear or favour. “I would appeal that you (PCCB ) also make close follow up to all funds channeled to implement development projects in the region,” he said.
