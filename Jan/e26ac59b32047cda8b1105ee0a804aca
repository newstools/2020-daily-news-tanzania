JUSTICE and Constitutional Affairs Minister Dr Augustine Mahiga has said that Tanzania will continue respecting the principles of separation of powers, insisting that the judiciary was independent and it can never be interfered with by any other organ of the state in the course of discharging its duties. The minister said that currently, his ministry was currently implementing its plan to overhaul the entire justice dispensation system by reviewing all laws and regulations that were enacted many years ago so that they reflect the current situation. Dr Mahiga was responding to a question posed by Special Seats MP Sophia Mwakagenda (CHADEMA) who claimed that the judiciary was being driven by political interests. In her main question, Ms Mwakagenda said as per GN No 222 and 223 of 1972 and its statutory amendments in 2002, members of the jury were being appointed by ruling CCM meetings and that the integrity committees of magistrates were under the chairmanship of regional and district commissioners. “In this case, when will the judiciary distance itself from these political affiliations?’’ he inquired. Responding, Dr Mahiga said the judiciary was one of the three organs of the state under the constitution, adding that it was an independent entity. In the course of discharging its duties, the minister added, the judiciary was using members of the jury at the primary and high courts who ought to be obtained as per the regulations of members of the jury, who are appointed basing on their requisite qualifications, including age and experience in their communities.
