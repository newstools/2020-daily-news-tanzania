Mr Jafo made a statement at a special meeting to discuss a report on the implementation of CCM manifesto prepared by Deputy Minister for Ĺivestock and Fisheries who is also the MP for Mkuranga Constituency Abdallah Ulega in Mkuranga District on Thursday. “We have given you enough time to accomplish these projects. Any district or town council director who fails to do so by January 15 will have to write a letter, explaining why he or she shouldn’t be removed from the post,” he said. He noted that the government released funds for the construction of 52 health centres across the country as one of its initiatives to improve health services, adding that it was the government’s intention to see that the money was utilised as planned and the projects were completed on time. Mkuranga District is among the districts which had received the funds in the first and second phase and managed to construct Mkamba and Kisiju health centres and another health centre was expected to be constructed at Vikindu Village. Earlier, Mr Jafo launched X -ray and ultrasound services at Mkuranga District Hospital and inspected the ongoing construction of a modern labour ward. The minister also had time to inspect a water project worth 5.6bn/- which was expected to be completed in May this year. For her part, Member of Parliament (Special Seats- CCM) Zainab Vullu asked the health minister for more health workers for Mkuranga District Hospital which previously had the capacity to accommodate only 80 expectant mothers per month, but now the number had reached 300 expectant mothers per month.
