Professor Kabudi added that, the project has also provided around 600 employment opportunities to the Tanzanian citizens. In his remarks, Mr Thorleifsson said the purpose of the fund was to invest in various projects within sub-Saharan Africa that will help the countries’ economy to grow fast. “By the end of 2018 the fund that was already invested in the country was 160m/- US dollars injected in various projects covering energy, finance, food and agriculture sectors.
