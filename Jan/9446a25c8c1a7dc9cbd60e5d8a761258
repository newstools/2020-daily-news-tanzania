AUTHORITIES in Mara Region are happy with efforts made by Grumeti Reserves to increase the population of black rhinos in the Serengeti ecosystem. “Grumeti Reserves has done a big job to import nine black rhinos. This is one of their most exciting projects,” Mara Regional Commissioner (RC) Adam Malima said in Musoma recently. The rhinos were imported from South Africa in September last year, thanks to collaboration between the government of Tanzania and Grumeti Reserves. The RC commended the company’s efforts at the annual meeting of Mara Regional Press Club. Grumeti Reserves is a conservation and eco-tourism company that operates several world class luxurious lodges in Western Serengeti. Speaking on the occasion, Grumeti Reserves Relationships Manager Ami Seki said the number of resident wild animals had increased sharply in wildlife conservation areas managed by Grumeti Reserves. The investor also spends millions of shillings on supporting social development in Serengeti and Bunda districts. Giving an example, Mr Seki said the company had spent about 1.5bn/- on sponsoring about 600 students and drilling boreholes in communities adjacent to Ikorongo/Grumeti Game Reserves between 2003 and 2016. The investor is also giving Serengeti District Council 200m/- every year. Serengeti District Council officials say the money has been injected into various development projects meant to transform the lives of residents as the provision of social services is the company’s priority. Grumeti Reserves says it has also created about 900 jobs from $175m investments in Tanzania. About 95 per cent of the Grumeti Reserves workers are Tanzanians. It is estimated that every job supports eight people in rural Africa, according to the World Bank.
