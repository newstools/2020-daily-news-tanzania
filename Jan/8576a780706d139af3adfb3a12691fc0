THE Financial Crime Unit has not yet received the mutual legal assistance to complete the investigations into a 10tril/- fraud, tax evasion and money laundering trial involving seven people, including senior officials with four subsidiary companies of the defunct Acacia Mining Limited. This was said by State Attorney, Ester Martin, for the prosecution, before Senior Resident Magistrate Godfrey Isaya at the Kisutu Resident Magistrate's Court in Dar es Salaam yesterday when the case came up for mention. The trial attorney requested for another mention date as some foreign countries have not responded to the mutual legal assistance sought on areas the prosecution had applied for. "Investigations into the case are incomplete. We have not yet received the responses on legal mutual assistance. Under the circumstances, we request this court to set another mention date," the trial attorney submitted. The magistrate granted the request and adjourned the trial to January 31, 2020. A mutual legal assistance treaty is an agreement between two or more countries of gathering and exchanging information in an effort to enforce public or criminal laws. Modern states have developed mechanisms for requesting and obtaining evidence for criminal investigations and prosecutions. When evidence or other forms of legal assistance, such as witness statements or service of documents, are needed from a foreign sovereign, states may attempt to cooperate informally through their police agencies or, alternatively, resort to what is typically referred to as requests for "mutual legal assistance." The accused persons in the matter include President of Pangea Minerals Limited, Bulyanhulu Gold Mine Limited and North Mara Gold Mine Limited, as well as Exploration Minieres Du Nord LTEE Deogratias Mwanyika and Managing Director of the three companies Asa Mwaipopo.
