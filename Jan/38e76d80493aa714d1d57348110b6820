THE Minister for Minerals Mr Dotto Biteko has issued a oneweek ultimatum to State Mining Corporation (STAMICO) to take legal measures against its staff associated with embezzling the Corporation’s drilling funds. The Minister issued the directive in Dar es Salaam noting the government had invested a lot in the project by purchasing modern multi-purpose air rotary drill rig worth 1.1 million US dollars (2.3 bn/ -) that should not end up in individual pockets. “I have information that there are people who are unfaithful in the drilling project,” he said, while directing STAMICO Managing Director, Dr V enance Mwasse to take stern measure against all the suspects and hand him over a report within a week. Mr Biteko who was presiding over the STAMICO Workers Council further said that the government has been reaping benefits from the project, which ought to be sustained and produce more than what it offers currently. Earlier according to a report issued to the minister by STAMICO management, the project through the drilling machine has so far produced 4.6 bn/ -including 6 00m/ - being benefit per year. However, in response Mr Biteko said that the project should be producing more than the 6 00m/ - if properly managed. Expounding, he noted that the embezzlement was made possible by forging receipts and invoices unnecessary and hence, asked the Managing Director to act tough on the suspects. He further directed that the STAMICO should ensure that the stolen money was recovered to purchase another drilling machine for the bigger benefit of the country. In a related development, Mr Biteko urged STAMICO to avoid entering into agreements of any nature, unless allowed by the Attorney General.
