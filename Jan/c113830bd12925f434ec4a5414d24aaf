ISLES league champions KMKM have re-called two veteran players in a move to strengthen the squad for the Isles Premier League. The players are Maulid Ibrahim Kapenta and Saidi Bura, who have been out of the squad for three seasons, but plying for KMKM’s Veterans team. Kapenta and his team mate were in the KMKM squad that played in FA Cup match against Ngome on Tuesday and KMKM won 6-0. The team’s Head Coach, Ameir Msimu confirmed to the reporters here about the players’ comeback call saying their experience is still needed to help the team perform well because most of the key players were attending occupational courses. “We have re-called them to help us fill the gap left by the players who are attending training. They will remain with us until they all complete the course and return here,” he said. He said the players are still well drilled only overweight is the big challenge facing them. “We believe with proper training they will be fit like others,” he added. KMKM have completed a five-player option given in the January mini-transfer window. KMKM are the Isles Premier League defending champions and they are currently on the pilot seat with 26 points. Zimamoto are second with 25 points.
