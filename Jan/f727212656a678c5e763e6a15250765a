THE Nkasi District Commissioner, Mr Said Mtanda, has ordered Nkasi District Executive Director (DED), Mr Missana Kwangura, who is planning to travel to Dodoma for official duties, to do so by bus, after failing to pay councillors’ dues on time. According to Mr Mtanda, councillors for Nkasi District were demanding payments, including sitting allowances after holding a Full Council meeting but the executive director was yet to effect them. Other officials who are planning to travel to Dodoma alongside the District executive director in two-day’s time include Nkasi District Council Chairman Mr Sumuni Mwanakulya and three other leaders whose names could not be immediately established. “DED (Mr Kwangura) and other officials who will be with you on the trip to Dodoma must not get travelling allowances simply because the DED’s office has failed to pay councillors their dues, including sitting allowances,” Mr Mtanda said. The District Commissioner wants the DED and his delegation to travel by bus as opposed to government cars in order to reduce government expenditure. Mr Mtanda’s decisions featured in a councillors special meeting in Namanyere township which discussed and endorsed proposals for the 2020-21 Financial Year budget draft . He told the delegates that during the 2020- 21 financial year, the council estimated to spend over 28.9 bn/- for expenditure and execution of development projects. “Over 25.9 bn/- is a block grant from the central government out of which over 20.9 bn/- will be spent on paying civil servants’ salaries, 1.8 bn/- for provision of social and economic services , while 3.2 bn/- will be committed to investment on requisite infrastructures as well as capacity building,” noted the DED. According to the DED, over 2.4bn/-was from the council’s own sources, out of which over 108m/- would be spent on civil servants’ salaries and over 921.6 m/- for implementation of development projects .
