THE Prevention and Combating of Corruption Bureau (PCCB) in Dodoma Region plans an education programmes in all districts of the region on how to avoid being involved in corrupt practices ahead of the 2020 general election. Addressing a press conference, Dodoma Region PCCB Commander Sostheness Kibwengo said the new move was part of the first quarter of an education strategy to be provided between January and March this year. Mr Kibwengo said among other strategies, during the first quarter, PCCB equally planned to collect information on corruption and deter all those intending to solicit or offer bribes during the general election. “PCCB will deal with whoever intends to engage him/herself in corruption before, during and even after the general election,” he warned. During the first quarter, the PCCB regional boss warned the antigraft watchdog would continue discharging its duties, including providing education on corruption as it was doing during the second half of the year which ended in December 2019. “PCCB will continue with its efforts in raising awareness as well as asking people to participate in a campaign against corruption in different parts of the region as well as during the general election,” he added. According to him, PCCB did the same in preventing corrupt practices during the local government election conducted towards the end of last year, adding that it was equally committed to doing the same in the anticipated general election. The PCCB regional boss added that PCCB would continue with its campaign dubbed ‘Break the Silence, Say No to Sex Corruption’, insisting that between October and December 2019, PCCB aired about 43 radio and television programmes to educate members of the community on the effects of corruption. He said PCCB in the region organised 84 rallies to educate various community groups, politicians, students, public servants as well as the private sector on how they could fight against corruption in all its forms.
