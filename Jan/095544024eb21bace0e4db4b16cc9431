NATURAL Resources and Tourism Deputy Minister Constantine Kanyasu has condemned incidents of people encroaching the newly established forest reserves, beating up and killing forest officers. He made the remarks yesterday, shortly after inspecting the construction of seven houses worth 1.3bn/- to be used by forest officials in Biharamulo forest located in Chato District, Geita region. Mr Kanyasu vowed that the government would take strong legal actions against those who will be found guilty of such unlawful acts. The deputy minister cited the recent killings of two game reserve officers in Kaliua District, Tabora region saying the murder thwarted government’s efforts to develop the conservation sector. “I have instructed the leaders in Tabora region to hunt down the suspects so that they can face the law,” He said, adding that he has also tasked the Chato District Commissioner Charles Kabeho to ensure those who have invaded the Biharamulo forest reserve are arrested. Mr Kanyasu claimed that the ministry through Tanzania Forest Service Agency (TFS) doesn’t have any forest; “we are only taking care of the available forests for the greater interest of everyone in the country.” He also extended a warning to people who have a tendency of raiding forest officers, saying all the officers have been given guns for their routine activities. “So it is too dangerous, all of the officers have attended military training for six months in order for them to be able to fight those who will invade the reserved areas,” he explained. The deputy minister also expressed his disappointment over the continued activities by small miners in Geita region that cause deforestation, warning of possible drought if immediate intervention would not be taken. According to the deputy minister, the effects have started to be witnessed in Kigoma region, and asked the miners to stop it immediately.
