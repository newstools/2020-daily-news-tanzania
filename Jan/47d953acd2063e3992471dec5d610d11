SIMBA’s Meddie Kagere continues to command Tanzania Mainland Premier League run, firmly ahead of the rest in the race for the golden boot. Kagere who has netted 10 goals from his team’s 14-match outings, has remained the most brilliant goal scorer and the most successful non-Tanzanian in the league. Compared to the previous three seasons, the number of the non-East Africans continue to diminish among the 20 teams engaged in the league. Notable non East Africans in the league are Serge Paschal Wawa of Simba, Z imbabwean duo; Donald Ngoma and Bruce Kangwa who play for Azam and Congolese Deo Kanda who plays for Simba. The mini-transfer window has seen the arrival of Haruna Niyonzima, a Rwandese midfield maestro who has rejoined Young Africans after serving Simba and AS Kigali. Also reportedly heading to Young Africans is TP Mazembe deadly winger, Owe Bonyanga who will join Ivorian Yikpe Ghislain, who is likely to be the second Ivorian after Wawa of Simba. Altogether, Yanga seem to part ways with Congolese striker David Molinga before the closure of the mini transfer window. But the most unique signing was done by the former head coach of Simba SC, Patrick Aussems who snatched three players from Brazil. The players included;Tairone da Silva, Henrique da Silva and Gerson Fraga are the Brazilian trio. Only two of them are still serving Simba, with Henrique da Silva parting ways with the club. However, the former coach told Simba supporters to be patient saying it will take time for the three to fully adapt to the playing style of African teams. “All my new players are good, but people should not expect a lot from the three Brazilians,” was once quoted by the media. Still the Premier League misses the services of Ghanaians James Kotei and Asante Kwasi who served well Simba in the last season. Both are no longer serving Simba.
