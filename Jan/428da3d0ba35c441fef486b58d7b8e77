THE ten-year Treasury bond minimum successful price moved up by 126 basis points indicating the central bank leaves a room for rate increase this year. The minimum price increase of 1.54 per cent at the auction yesterday was also described as the central bank maintains bond investors as the country heads to General Election later this year. Zan Securities said in Treasury Bond Rates in 2019 and Outlook for 2020 report that in retrospect, all factors were aligned with their last week sentiment as the subscription level was low at 33 per cent. “We believe the BoT is leaving a room for rates increase in the next year and beyond to maintain investors as the country prepares for the next year’s general elections,” Zan said in the report yesterday. Zan, one of the leading brokerage firms, projected that the yesterday 10 –year bond auction might offer a relief to investors following almost a yearlong decline in rates. However, Zan said “today’s (yesterday) results came as a surprise to us as the minimum successful price moved up by 126 basis points or 1.54 per cent. “Surprisingly, the Bank of Tanzania opted for a highway leaving 31bn/- on the table”.
