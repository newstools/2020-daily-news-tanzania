THE Government has directed the Occupational Safety and Health Authority (OSHA) to expand its scope of services countrywide by exploiting digital technology. Permanent Secretary (PS) in the Prime Minister’s Office (Policy, Parliament, Employment, Youth and the Disabled), Andrew Massawe, gave the directive when toured OSHA offices in Dar es Salaam over the weekend. “This is a fundamental matter; we need to put emphasis on offering services through automation, though we first need to have offices at all strategic areas,” Mr Massawe said. On other hand, the PS tasked OSHA to educate the public on the law on health and safety at workplaces. “During this period when the government is focusing on building an industrial economy, we want the industrial revolution to move hand in hand with adherence to health and safety at workplaces in order to avoid effects that could occur due to defiance of the law,” he stated. Mr Massawe was speaking during a meeting with the management of OSHA in the city. His meeting was aimed at getting a feedback on implementation of various guidelines that his docket had been giving in improving services to citizens. The PS received a report from OSHA Chief Executive Officer Khadija Mwenda on implementation of directives from the ministry. Apart from giving a feedback on how the authority implemented the directives, Ms Mwenda also gave a briefing on a plan to open a western zone office in Tabora that will serve Tabora, Kigoma, Rukwa and Katavi regions. She also briefed the PS on the successes OSHA had recorded after using various government systems, including the Government Electronic Payment Gateway (GePG) and Tanzania National Electronic Procurement System (TANePS). The PS said he was satisfied with the implementation of various directives that had been issued to the authority, especially the application of systems that the government had introduced.
