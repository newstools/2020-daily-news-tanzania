POLICE in Coast Region are holding 27 illegal immigrants of Ethiopian origin, Coast Regional Police Commander (RPC) ACP Wankyo Nyigesa has confirmed. According to the RPC, 11 of them were arrested on 14th January, 2020, and 16 arrested on the following day at Mlingotini area, Zinga Ward in Bagamoyo District in a Police patrol. “After arresting them and completing interrogations, we managed to establish that all of them had entered the country through Mlingotini, being one of the illegal entry points of many illegal immigrants,” he said. The RPC further said that the suspects used a dhow that was still anchored at the Beach, adding that Police are still looking for its owner. Elaborating, he said that they seemed to be on transit to South Africa to look for green pastures. The suspects are expected to be handed over to the Immigration Department anytime for further legal actions. However, he warned the area residents to desist from transporting illegal immigrants though unlicensed borders, saying the crime denies the government revenue, besides being a criminal offence.
