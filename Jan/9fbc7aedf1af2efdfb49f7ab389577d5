DEFENDING Mainland Premier League champions Simba SC management has refuted match tampering allegations leveled against the club by Young Africans goalie, Ramadhan Kabwili. A press statement released by the club on Tuesday and shared on various social media platform said the club is regretting over accusations made by the player at one of local radio station, treating them as “despicable, disrespectful and tantamount to severe allegations.” “These statements have severe adverse implications on the integrity of Simba Sports Club and its leaders. The credibility of the League and Football in Tanzania as a whole will be put into question if such statements are not dealt with decisively,” the statement signed by Simba’s Chief Executive Officer, Senzo Mbatha noted. On the other hand, Simba SC has welcomed the quick reaction at which the Tanzania Football Federation (TFF) has swiftly addressed and taken the matter up as the relevant authority. “Simba SC trusts that this matter is in the right hands and shall be dealt with appropriately with speed,” the CEO said and added: “The club continues to adequately prepare for the matches and provide the necessary support to the team and its technical bench going forward.”
