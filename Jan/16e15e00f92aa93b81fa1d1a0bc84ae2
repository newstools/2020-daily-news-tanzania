COUNCILORS and business experts have been pointed out as crucial components in discussing various issues related to business development in the country and thus posing the need for them to attend district business councils. According to the study conducted by the Tanzania National Business Council (TNBC) on the effectiveness and sustainability of regional and district business councils, there is need to attend the experts in business and councilors to ensure proper implementation of various plans on business development in the country. The report recommends that the councilors could only be invited as observers. The 36-page candid report on best practices and lessons learned so far from public private dialogue at regional and district levels in Tanzania, also recommends appropriate individuals and representatives of civil society organisations to attend the meetings. It says the study revealed that ministries, departments and agencies dealing with business and investment were invited to attend the meetings, giving examples of TANESCO, TANROAD, SUMATRA, TRA, TBS and TFDA. Public and private sectors are each represented in the council. The report says it would be a good practice to include individuals with expertise on particular issues for discussion, representatives of informal sector and informal businesses. The study was funded by the Local Investment Climate Project (LIC) and the Enabling Growth through Investment and Enterprise Project (ENGINE). The TNB was started in September 2001, its main objective is to promote business and investment climate through public private dialogue. At national level TNBC meetings are chaired by President of the United Republic and at regional and district levels the council meetings are chaired by RCs and DCs respectively.
