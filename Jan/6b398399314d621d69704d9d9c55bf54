MINISTER for Minerals Doto Biteko has shut down an illegal gold processing factory in Bunanga Village, Kahama District, and directed the arrest of Village Executive Officer (VEO) Kajanja Kajanja. The processing plant, which is owned by Mr Simon Shule, is situated in human settlement, putting the health of villagers at great risk due to environmental pollution. According to the minister, the plant has been emitting toxic chemicals in total disregard for people’s health. The minister said it was sad to learn that despite the government’s efforts to improve the mining industry for all stakeholders, including small-scale miners in the country, some individuals were still engaging in illegal gold mining, thus depleting natural resources and denying the government revenue. “This plant has been operational for over seven months without following laws and regulations. We are going to take stern legal measures against the owner to deter others to engage in similar acts,” Mr Biteko said. Meanwhile, the minister has directed the police in Msalala, Kahama District, to arrest and interrogate Mr Kajanja in connection with the unregistered mineral processing plant. A total of 44 bags believed to contain gold were also seized at the bogus plant. The bags contained chemicals used in gold processing.
