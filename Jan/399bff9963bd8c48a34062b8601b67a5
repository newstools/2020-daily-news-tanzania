THE police are hunting for a man alleged to have defiled two minors in the region. The man is said to have committed the offence on January 9, this year, in Maisaka, Babati Municipal Council. Confirming the incident at the weekend, Manyara Regional Police Commander SACP Paul Kasabago said the man allegedly defiled the two minors, one aged 7 and the other 8 years on their way home from Maisaka Primary School. According to Mr Kasabago, the unidentified man lured the unsuspecting pupils into a bush where he gave each, 500/- before defiling them in turns. “The man warned them against telling anyone what had happened to them,” alleged the regional police boss. It was a change in the way they walked that made the parents suspect something was wrong with them and so they decided to take them to Mrara Health Centre for medical check-up and it was confirmed they had been defiled. “The culprit is still at large, but the police are hunting for the man,” said Mr Kasabago. He further urged parents in the region to ensure their children were safe all the time from such culprits. In another development, the police in Manyara have arrested a Mirerani resident after being found in possession of 6.69grammes of Tanzanite. Jimmy Fredrick was allegedly arrested on January 8, this year, following an impromptu inspection at an undisclosed exit gate on Mirerani Hills. The suspect is said to have hid a few precious gemstones in his mouth as he tried to flee. The stolen minerals have since been preserved at the regional mineral office as investigation into the matter is going on.
