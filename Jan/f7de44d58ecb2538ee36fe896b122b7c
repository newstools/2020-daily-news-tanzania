ZANZIBAR Premier League giants, Mlandege bid farewell to the Isles FA Cup tournament after a 1-0 loss to JKU in a tough game held here at Amaan Stadium on Wednesday. The best of 16-game between the two giants was fiercely contested and attracted a huge audience. JKU under Coach, Hassan Pele looked determined to win the match as they planned careful raids just from a start to the end. Hadn’t been for Mlandege’s solid defence, the score could be bigger than one goal. Still despite losing the game, Mlandege under Coach, Sheha Khamis had themselves to blame for the loss as they created many scoring chances, but squandered all of them. JKU who are among the top-placed sides in the ongoing Isles Premier League netted their winner late in the first half in 33rd minute through Shekhuu Magaji. The team went to the breather leading 1-0 and the goal remained until the end of the 90th minute. JKU had eliminated African Coast on walkover before facing Mlandege on Wednesday. JKU had to be awarded a walkover after their opponents failed to turn up for the fixture. At Mao Tse Dong in Unguja, Dulla Boys defeated giants KMKM 1-0.
