PRESIDENT of the Tanzania Football Federation (TFF) Wallace Karia (pictured) has been appointed in a special FIFA committee, tasked to reform the structure of Africa Zonal Associations (AZA). Karia, who is also the president of Council for East and Central Africa Football Associations (CECAFA), is among five individuals, who have been appointed by FIFA in the committee which have been tasked to reform structure of football in the continent. Other members of the committee, which will be headed by the CAF President Ahmad Ahmad are CAF Secretary General, Mouad Hajji, Mario Gallavotti (FIFA) and Niger Football Federation president, Hamidou Djibrilla. According to Karia, apart from working on re-restructuring of zonal associations/federations organization systems, the committee will look at various areas such as administration, referees, coaches, competitions and partnerships with FIFA regional offices in developing football especially at the school level. It will also work on establishing disciplinary instruments, which are vital in competitions and technical assistance. The committee will be coordinated by FIFA Football Stakeholders Committee through its Members Department, which will supervise and coordinate meeting sessions of the Special Committee, until the completion of their tasks. The special committee had been formed after a meeting between FIFA and Confederation of African Football (CAF) and AZA held recently in Zurich, Switzerland, led by FIFA President Gianni Infantino. At the session, CAF was represented by President Ahmad, his Secretary General Hajji and Genan Korra, while FIFA was represented by FIFA President Gianni Infantino, Veron Mosengo-Omba, who is Head of FIFA Member Department and Solomon Mudege.
