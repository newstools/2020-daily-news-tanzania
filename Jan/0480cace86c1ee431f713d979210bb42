TANZANIA Sports Writers Association (TASWA) has once again pushed forward its special general assembly, which was earlier planned to be staged this weekend in Dar es Salaam. According to the statement released yesterday in Dar es Salaam by TASWA Secretary General, Amir Mhando, the special general meeting, which was scheduled for tomorrow will now be held on January 19th, this year. Mhando said that the association move was due to requests by some members, following their failure to meet the set deadline for them to confirm their participation. “TASWA felt that it is important for the special general meeting to be attended by many of its members; if not all of them…this is why we have agreed to postpone the Sunday’s (tomorrow) meeting to January 19th this year. This will provide ample time for the members to make their confirmation,” he said. During the meeting, members will discuss several issues concerning the association, whereby the Constitution Amendment Committee formed by the National Sports Council (NSC) will also present their report to the members. Members will as well receive recommendations from TASWA’s outgoing Executive Committee. Mhando said the deadline for members to confirm their participation will be on Monday. He said all members should send the confirmations through the following emails: taswatz@yahoo.com , mgosius@yahoo.com or machagift@gmail.com.
