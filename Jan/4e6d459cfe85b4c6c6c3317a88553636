THE Prevention and Combating of Corruption Bureau (PCCB) in Coast Region has managed to recover 217,481,498/- , which was mistakenly paid to farmers by the Agricultural and Marketing Cooperative Societies (AMCOS) and Cereal and other Produce Board (CPB). PCCB Acting Regional Officer Mr Sadiki Nombo said on Wednesday that the money was recovered from Mkuranga, Kibiti, Rufiji na Kisarawe districts respectively. He said that so far a total of 67,908,958/-have been paid to farmers who deserved the payment in Kibiti District. “We have managed to recover the money, which was mistakenly paid to wrong farmers, at the same time, we have successfully supervised the payment of over 67m/- to farmers in Kibiti district,” he said. He added that at least 16,275,000/-has been paid to the farmers in Rufiji District making a total of 84,183,958 shillings which has already been paid to the farmers. According to the PCCB acting regional boss, the verification exercise is still going on to enable other farmers who were denied payments to get paid as well. Mr Nombo said, earlier some farmers received double payment during the payment programme while others received nothing. “Some of farmers were paid twice while some did not receive anything, this forced us to intervene to rescue the situation,” he noted. He added that some farmers took their cashewnuts to AMCOS but they did not get the payments as expected instead they were told that some payment documents were missing. In another development, Mr Nombo said a total of 13 projects worth 2,537,912 252,.30/-were inspected in a period of 3 months and that three of them have been earmarked for investigation because they have been implemented below standards.
