YOU will now be allowed to use the National Identification Number (NIN) to access any service in the country that requires you to present National Identity Card, Prime Minister Kassim Majaliwa told the National Assembly yesterday. “We have issued directives to all National Identification Authority (NIDA) officials in all Districts, towns and City Councils that they release a list of all names of people they registered at their respective stations, and also display them so that people can easily get their numbers,” he further said. Expounding, he said that the government had intensified its systems especially at the country’s border points to ensure that residents of neighbouring countries do not penetrate and obtain the country’s IDs. Therefore, Mr Majaliwa said, there could be unprecedented delays in issuance of NIN and IDs in the regions that are bordering our neighbouring countries just for security reasons, adding that the registration is only for Tanzanians. “We doing this exercise keenly with an intention to provide the IDs to Tanzanians only, that is why I urge all Tanzanians to collaborate with responsible authorities and volunteer information of non-citizens, who want to use this opportunity to obtain our documents illegally with a view to protecting defence and security of the country,” said the Premier. Mr Majaliwa was responding to an impromptu question posed by Buhigwe Lawmaker, Albert Obama (CCM) who expressed his dismay over delays in issuance of the NIN and IDs to residents in both rural and urban areas. “I understand that Mr Obama comes from Buhigwe which borders neighbouring country of Burundi, therefore, there could be some delays there, but it is only for a good reason that we don’t issue the IDs to Burundians,’’ said Mr Majaliwa.
