PUMP price of petrol has increased by 45/- per litre for the month of January which is equivalent to 2.07 per cent rise that will force motorists dig deeper in their pocket at the beginning of the year. However, motorists using diesel will have started the year with relief as prices declined by 5/- per litre, equal to 0.21 per cent change. The Energy and Water Utilities Regulatory Authority (EWURA) announced on Wednesday that the changes in local prices are mainly attributed to changes in the world oil market prices and an increase in Bulk Procurement System (BPS) premiums. Similarly, compared to the publication of last month, wholesale prices of petrol increased by 44.53/- per litre, equal to 2.19 per cent while those of diesel decreased by 4.51/- per litre (0.23 per cent). Kerosene prices will remain the same as those that were published on December last month because there is no new consignment of Kerosene that was received through Dar es Salaam port in the month of December 2019. For the month of January, retail and wholesale prices of petroleum products in the northern regions namely Tanga, Kilimanjaro, Arusha and Manyara shall continue to be the same as were published last month. The fuel prices in the northern regions remained unchanged because there was no new consignment of petroleum products that was received through Tanga port in the month of December 2019. Similarly, for the month of January 2020, retail and wholesale prices of petrol and diesel in the southern regions including Lindi, Mtwara and Ruvuma will remain the same as those published last month because there was no new consignment of petroleum products that was received through Mtwara port in the month of December 2019. Furthermore, since there is no Kerosene at Mtwara storage terminals, petrol station operators in Mtwara, Lindi and Ruvuma regions are advised to source the product from Dar es Salaam and therefore, the retail prices of Kerosene for those regions is based on the cost of the product received through Dar es Salaam port and bridging cost to the regions.
