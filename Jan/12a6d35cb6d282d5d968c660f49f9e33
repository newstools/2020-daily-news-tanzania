SERENGETI Breweries Limited (SBL) has reiterated its commitment to continue supporting local communities in different parts of the country through various corporate social responsibility programs. SBL’s Managing Director, Mark Ocitti said at a meeting with editors in Dar es Salaam in Dar es Salaam recently that the company will cement its support in different areas such as water provision, support towards local farmers and education. “In the area of water provision, we are looking forward to implement more projects in addition to the existing 17 which collectively provide about 2 million people with free, clean and safe water,” he said. He said SBL supports local farmers in the areas where it sources raw materials for beer production through provision of free seeds, field technical services and linking them to financial institutions for loans. SBL currently sources over 70 percent of raw materials used for its beer production locally with the current uptake of barley, maize and sorghum soaring to 17,000 metric tons per year-and still growing. In the area of education support to local communities Ocitti said, under Kilimo-Viwanda project, SBL has initiated a scholarship program to strengthen the exiting pool of agricultural experts in Local Raw Material growing regions. They are also in line with SBL’s goal to increase its Local Raw Material Sourcing Program (LRM). “The sponsorship will be extended to 30 students pursuing diplomas in agriculture-based courses and the selected students must come from SBL’s Local Raw Materials (LRM) areas or any area as long as they are ready and willing to work in LRM areas after their studies.,’ he said. SBL is the producer of the famous Serengeti Premium lager as well as the Superbrands-winning brand, Serengeti Premium lite, among other quality beers.
