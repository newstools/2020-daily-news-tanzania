THE Minister of State in Prime Minister’s Office (Investment) Ms Angela Kairuki has said the government will continue to look for possibilities of producing necessary goods to encourage local industrialisation and discourage imports. Ms Kairuki was speaking after touring Heister Biosciences Africa Limited, which is owned by Hester Biosciences Limited India, a high tech animal vaccine industry in Kibaha Town, Coast Region. “Despite the fact that our country is ranking number three with high number of domestic animals in Africa, we are still depending on imported vaccines. This industry is an example of the government efforts in seeking possibilities of producing necessary goods here in our country,” she said. Project’s Coordinator Ms Tina Sokoine said the ongoing construction 18 million US dollars’ worth project has reached 65 per cent and that the first production is expected to start between April and June with two vaccines whereby marketing for the products will start in December this year. “When complete, this industry will have the capacity of producing 1.5 billion doses of animal vaccines, producing 37 types of vaccinations for 26 types of diseases. These vaccines will be used for poultry, cows, sheep, goats and pigs,” she said adding that about 200 individuals will be employed.
