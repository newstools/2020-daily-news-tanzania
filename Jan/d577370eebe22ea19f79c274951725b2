THE Government Procurement Services Agency (GPSA) purchased 599 vehicles from 2018/19 financial year to June last year, saving 4.7bn/- government funds through bulk procurement. GPSA Chief Executive Officer, Dr Geraldine Rasheli, gave the statistics during the workers’ council meeting, saying the procurement of the 599 vehicles was done at a cost of 96.69bn/-. “Through joint procurement, we purchased 599 government vehicles from 242 public institutions; we cut down the cost by 4.7bn/- if the institutions were to undertake the task themselves,” he said. The money saved was through tendering process (1.5bn/-) and 3.4bn/- through discount offered through bulk purchase. Moreover, he said, GPSA was now offering clearing and forwarding services to public institutions, increasing the loads value from 40.3bn/- in 2017/18 to 68.1bn/- every month by the end of the 2018/19 financial year. “From July 2019 to December last year, the value of cleared government loads stood at 700m/-, while the increasing value of the loads from 200m/- a year to 150m/- a month in 2019/20 have boosted the GPSA revenue collection,” said Dr Rasheli. He said shortage of staff had failed them in the clearing and forwarding unit but they teamed up with the Labour and Youth division where they imparted youth with the requisite skills and assisted them in the field for best and timely services. The GPSA CEO said in the 2020/21 financial year, they plan to collect 79.1bn/- revenue through a number of their income generation projects, service charges and agency fee for increased efficiency. Presenting the 2018/19 implemented plans, he said the agency planned to purchase petroleum and sale of petroleum equipment worth 38.1bn/- but as of June last year, they surpassed the target by 135 per cent. To bring services closer to consumers, Dr Rasheli said they had opened a centre in Kahama District, to enable public institutions to easily access the services, while in Kagera Region, they had set aside a special day for delivering petroleum and its equipment to them. Opening the council meeting, Commissioner for Public Procurement Policy in the Ministry of Finance and Planning, Dr Fredrick Mwakibinga, wanted those in public procurement to go for contractors that are experienced and offer value for money. Dr Mwakibinga called upon GPSA employees to observe ethics, discipline and accountability in their service delivery so that the goals they set can be easily attained.
