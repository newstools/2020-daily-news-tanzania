BIG Tree beach soccer club and Stone Town’s Gold Swimming suffered defeats from Young Boys and Green River respectively in the Mapinduzi Cup Championship yesterday at Bamboo Bububu Beach. Big Tree game came first and they massively lost 6-0 in a one sided game as the Big Tree kept chasing shadows throughout the game. Haji Jamal Mcongo, Ahmed Nassoro and Abdul Malik Baker were the Young Boys heroes, each scoring two goals. In the second match, Stone Town’s Gold Swimming were reduced to a mere punching bag as they suffered a 6-2 heavy defeat at the hands of impressive Green River. A hat trick from Faisal Mohamed, two goals from Amour Ali and a goal from Abdillah Haji gave Green River a deserved lead despite the effort from Abdul Hamid Baine and Said Bobish goals that had hope to bring them back in the game but it was impossible as Green River margin was big for them to make any turn around.
