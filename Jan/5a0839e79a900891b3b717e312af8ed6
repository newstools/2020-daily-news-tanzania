TANZANIA Medicines and Medical Devices Authority (TMDA) for northern zone have inspected over 3,160 consignments of medicines and medical devices imported in the past four years. Meanwhile, the zonal office has issued a total of 1,160 permits to importers of medicines and medical devices during the corresponding period. “This is in efforts to ensure that the public consumes drugs that are safe,” Mr Proches Patrick, TMDA’s manager for northern zone, said. He was explaining what the zonal office has done in improving the health of Tanzanians since the fifth phase government came to power. The authority’s zonal office serves 21 district councils in three regions of Kilimanjaro, Arusha and Manyara. It is in charge of controlling importation of drugs and medical devices through borders of Namanga, Holili and Tarakea. Mr Patrick said in the past four years, the zonal office has been supporting the government’s industrial agenda by encouraging its stakeholders to construct industries in the country to get rid of importing such products. “Stakeholders have been positive to our call, and as we speak, already one stakeholder has started constructing an industry here in Arusha for manufacturing veterinary medicines,” he said when briefing journalists and information officers from the Ministry of Health, Community Development, Gender, Elderly and Children and its institutions. He said TMDA will be offering technicalknow-how to industrialists so that they can produce medicines that are per required standards. The zonal office has also educated a total of 858 health workers from 152 health centres over how to report Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) through the online system of the TMDA.
