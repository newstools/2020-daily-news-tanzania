CRDB Bank managed to issue over 2.0 million TemboCards in the market last year to increase digital payment in the country. The bank said on Thursday that currently over 50,000 digital transactions are conducted per month using TemboCard. Despite the achievement, CRDB’s Head of Card Business, Farid Seif said still there is big room to change payment culture in the country from hard cash to plastic money. “This is a big achievement and the bank is proud of it,” Mr Seif said adding: “Though still a number of [TemboCard] customers are still not using their cards to make payments.” To increase the card outreach, the bank, which is listed on Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange (DSE), in collaboration with Visa International launched a special awareness campaign dubbed in Swahili “Chanja, Lipa, Sepa” loosely meaning ‘swap, pay and go’. To participate in the campaign a customer is supposed to use his/her TemboCard Visa or SimBanking Visa (QR Code) service when making payment in various shopping outlets or hotels, bars and cafes. “Those who are using their TemboCard Visa and SimBanking Visa will get a 60 per cent discount for every transaction that is above 30,000/-,” Mr Seif said during the launching of the campaign at GSM Home Shop, Mlimani City Mall. “Our aim is to shift Tanzanians’ cash transactions culture to digital, which is easier, safe and hassle free,” Mr Seif said.
