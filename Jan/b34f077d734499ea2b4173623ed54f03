THE fifth phase’s industrialisation drive has started paying dividends as the country’s export of processed products increased by 28 per cent by November last year. Speaking to reporters, Government Spokesperson, Dr Hassan Abbas, said exports fetched a record $996m. Dr Abbas named the processed products exported as iron sheets, glass wares, packing bags and iron bars, among others. Export increase is a blessing as the local market is filled with local products which previously were imported, but at the moment industries produce in excess for export. During the meeting, Dr Abbas noted that construction was a leading sector in its contribution to economic growth. He explained that monthly revenue collection had hit an average of 1.5tri/-between July and December last year, attributing the situation to members of public’s commitment to pay tax. “In 2015, the Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA)’s monthly contribution average was between 800bn/-and 850bn/-, but for the past three years it shot up to 1.3tri/-,” he said. He explained that the last half 2019/20 fiscal year (July to December) a new record average of 1.9tri/-was recorded and the figure expected to go up as days passed by. Dr Abbas, who also doubles as the Director of the Tanzania Information Services, said the country’s Serengeti National Park and wildebeest migration had been voted as the Africa’s most amazing places for travels in 2020 by CNN Travels. “As for the tourism sector,” he added, “great strides were made last year as the country ranked fourth in Africa for revenue collection from tourism.” He said the first country as far as tourism revenue collection was concerned in Africa was South Africa followed by Egypt, Morocco and Tanzania and with investment and promotion strategies the country would climb the ladder in revenue collection from the tourism sector. He used the occasion to advise Tanzanians to visit tourist attractions instead of leaving it to foreigners only.
