MORE than 40,000 trees have been planted in several parts of Namanyere township in Nkasi District, Rukwa Region, during a week-long campaign aimed for beautifying it and curbing the effects of deforestation. The Nkasi District Commissioner (DC), Mr Said Mtanda, praised Tanzania Forest Service (TFS) in the Southern Highland Zone for participating in the tree planting campaign focused on sensitising community members on the significance of planting and taking care of trees. Studies show that Tanzania is in danger of turning into a desert by 61 per cent due to an increase in the rate of deforestation although the country has abundant forests. "The district authority has already instructed local authorities to ensure that during this year each village plants 1,000 trees. Given the fact we have 90 villages in this district, we expect to turn this district green,” Mr Mtanda said. According to the district commissioner, each household is required to plant a tree with National Service camp and the newly established Miyula Secondary School, each required to plant 500 trees. “It is true that the more we plant and take care of trees, we curb desertification caused by deforestation and negative agricultural and livestock practices,” noted the DC. On his part, Acting TFS Manager from Southern Highland Zone, Mr Hamza Omari, said the initiative would also help sensitize members of the public on the significance of tree planting in the area where many people cut trees and don’t replace them. A cross-section of people in Namanyere conceded that many people here were not aware or didn’t care about the significance of planting and taking care of trees. "Some of them set fire bushes and clear grass, leaving the land naked, and some think that by doing so, they can keep the environment clean, " remarked Ben Pembe, one of the residents.
