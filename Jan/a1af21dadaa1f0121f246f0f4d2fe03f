THE National Bank of Commerce (NBC) has called upon Tanzanians to continue using the famous Malengo account as a solution to various financial challenges so that it will help them to fulfill their goals. Speaking to reporters in Dar es Salaam on Thursday during the third draw of the Ibuka Kidedea na Malengo campaign, NBC Brand and Communication Manager, David Raymond reiterated that the bank’s customers should continue using the bank services to solve their daily challenges. “This is the beginning of the year and many Tanzanians are facing a number of responsibilities including school fees, house rents, motor vehicles and home insurance. It is important that they remain close to NBC and those who have not yet opened malengo account should join the majority so that they can benefit from the bank with various gifts available in the campaign,” says Raymond. The Brand and Communications Manager said the bank has conducted the third draw since October last year and that winners of bodaboda and other who won a trip to Serengeti and Seychelles have visited and returned safely under the bank’s supervision and funding. In yesterday’s draw, five people emerged winners of the brand new Yamaha motorcycle, the winners were Luka Haule Baraka from Dodoma, Juma Halfani from Songea, Rebeka Ndoshi from Mwanza, Rosemary Kibodya from Dar es Salaam and Restituta Mbuya from Morogoro. The Ibuka Kidedea campaign will see three lucky winners driving away three- wheeled motorcycle in a draw to be conducted on March this year.
