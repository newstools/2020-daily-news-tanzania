SCORES of pupils from Kakuni Primary School at Kibaoni Ward in Mlele District, who failed to attend classes for five consecutive days after a bridge they were using was washed away, have resumed their lessons after it was restored. Acting Katavi Regional Tanroads Manager, Engineer , Martin Mwakabende said that the bridge’s restoration was made possible when they partnered with Mbuya Company Ltd contractors, who worked on it day and night. He said that the bridge, Mirumba Bridge that connects Namanyere-Kizi-Kibaoni in Mirumba village, further connects Rukwa and Katavi regions. “We constructed the bridge with steel transported from Kyela in Mbeya region and the whole work took seven days,” pointed out Eng Mwakabende. Reached for a comment, pupils from the school, expressed delight for the work that enabled them resume classes fast enough. They also commended Tanroands and the contractor, who made sure that life returned to normalcy in the regions. The bridge sits on River Kibaoni and subsequently cut off communication between the Kibaoni Ward and neighbouring areas as well as Mpimbwe Council. The same school was once attended by the former Prime Minister, Mr Mizengo Peter Pinda by then known as Kibaoni Primary School.
