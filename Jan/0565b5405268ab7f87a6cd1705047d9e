THE introduction of rescue helicopters has contributed to an increase in the number of tourists in Kilimanjaro Region, especially those climbing Mount Kilimanjaro. The good news was given by Kilimanjaro Regional Commissioner (RC) Anna Mghwira, while delivering her New Year greetings to residents of the region recently, whereby she also unveiled the implementation of development projects in the region in the past four years. “Kilimanjaro Search and Rescue Company (Kilimanjaro SAR)’s rescue services have increased the number of tourists especially those climbing Mount Kilimanjaro due to the fact that they are now sure of getting quick rescue services whenever they face challenges while climbing the mountain,” she said. Commenting on the implementation of various development projects in the region since the coming to power of the fifth phase government in 2015, Ms Mghwira said it included the renovation of all old public schools that she said involved Weruweru, Ashira, Same and Moshi technical secondary schools. “Other projects are the construction and renovation of Kilimanjaro International Airport (KIA) as well as the purchase of radar for KIA and the ongoing implementation of Same and Mwanga to Korogwe water project,” she said. She also mentioned other projects implemented during the four years as those of the construction of 32km Sanya Juu to Elerai Road which she said was constructed at tarmac level as well as the electrification of 482 villages in the region. As regards future plans, Ms Mghwira said all projects which were under implementation would be completed on time to provide space for the introduction of new development projects in the region.
