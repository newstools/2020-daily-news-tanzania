INTERNATIONAL Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals (Mechanism) Registrar Olufemi Elias has stressed the importance of support of member states in key areas of the Mechanism’s work. Speaking on the occasion of the 74th session of the United Nations General Assembly, Mr Elias outlined budgetary requirements of the Mechanism in 2020, emphasising a need for support by members state for timely and effective implementation of the Mechanism’s remaining judicial workload and ongoing functions at the Mechanism branches. “The support from member states is crucial in the dispensation of justice,” stressed the registrar. In his quick rejoinder, President of the 74th session of the UN General Assembly Muhammad-Bande expressed his unwavering support for the mandate and work of the Mechanism, stressing that its operations were essential for the continued development of international criminal justice. The registrar was in New York in connection with the consideration of the Mechanism’s budget submission for 2020 by the Administrative and Budgetary Committee (5th Committee) of the United Nations General Assembly. The Mechanism was established by the UN Security Council Resolution 1966 (2010) to complete the remaining work of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda and the International Criminal Tribunal for former Yugoslavia, which closed in 2015 and 2017, respectively. It has two branches, one in Arusha and the other one in The Hague. Its establishment is said to be a key step in the completion strategies of the two tribunals. Unlike national systems, the Mechanism has no police force and no powers of arrest. It remains reliant on the cooperation of national governments to arrest fugitives. Under the Mechanism’s statute, member states are obliged to cooperate unconditionally and comply with requests for assistance and orders of the Mechanism.
