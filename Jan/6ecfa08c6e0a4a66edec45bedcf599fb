A jubilant Aston Villa Coach Dean Smith spoke to the media after guiding the club he supports into the Carabao Cup final. Villa won 2-1 against Leicester City at Villa Park. The Aston Villa boss discussed his emotions, making the final, the Villa Park crowd and the subs who changed the game. On Mbwana Samatta debut he said, "I thought he did well. I knew he would tire at around 60 minutes. He stretches defenders, he gave Söyüncü and Evans a tough time and he linked play up well at times." "He’ll get better once he adjusts to the pace of the game. He probably needs to sort his feet out a little bit better for the chance he had in the first half but he almost got on the end of a super ball from Jack in the second half. He’ll be better for 60 minutes tonight. He showed us the potential he’s got." Smith said Carabao Cup Final is going to be tough against Manchester City or Manchester United, but the hard part is getting to a domestic cup final and Villa have managed to do that against a very good Leicester team.
