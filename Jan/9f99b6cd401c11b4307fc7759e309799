TANZANIA Education Authority (TEA) has appealed for more donations to support education and improve the learning environment in the country, saying that more of the support from well-wishers is needed for the country to attain quality learning environment which is a driving tool for development. Speaking on Friday in Dar es Salaam shortly after receiving five tons of iron sheets valued at 18 million shillings, donated by Yalin Global Limited, TEA Director General Ms Bahati Geuzye asked education stakeholders to contribute in improving education in the country. "Construction of classrooms, hostels, toilets, laboratories and teachers' residential houses are part of the projects which need good Samaritans' hand of support if we are to have good education infrastructures for quality learning,” she said. “I therefore call on companies, individuals and public institutions to donate and help improve education in the country," she said. Ms Geuzye, who was speaking at the short handing over ceremony in Dar es Salaam thanked the benefactors, saying that others must emulate such good acts by channeling educational infrastructures improvement donations through the Authority. According to Ms Geuzye, TEA knows better which schools in the country are affected by lack of primary infrastructure as some were located in remote areas where they could not be identified by contributors. She also said that channeling educational support through TEA, was also granting the government an opportunity to not only coordinate donations but also to coordinate them and to have clear statistics which help solve the challenges arising in the education sectors covering primary and secondary schools, colleges, vocational centres and universities. For his part, the Spokesperson of Yalin Global Ltd, Remmy Siame, said that his company which trades in iron sheets, have decided to donate five tonnes of the material valued at 18 million shillings for constructing classrooms, after being impressed by the government's efforts to improve education and to ensure that every Tanzanian child gets access to formal education. According to TEA, companies donating educational support through official channels are, apart from being recognised, given a special certificate which may be used to get tax amnesty per education Fund Act Number 8 of 2001 and the Tax Act of 2004.
