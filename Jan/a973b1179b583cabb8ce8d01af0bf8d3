KAHAMA District Commissioner Anamringi Macha has commended the Tanzania Bureau of Standards (TBS) efforts to provide entrepreneurs with knowledge and skills on quality assurance. He said the awareness campaigns across the country will help change the wrong perception of most entrepreneurs and other people that TBS is not for big industries and investors only. He made the remarks in Kahama District, Shinyanga Region, over the weekend during a seminar to entrepreneurs dealing with processing, distribution and sale of food and cosmetics on procedures to be followed to acquire quality standards mark. “There have been wrong notion among people particularly entrepreneurs that TBS works with big industries like beer and cement and not small and medium enterprises (SMEs),” he said. He said the standards watchdog was established to ensure all products in the Tanzania market meet the required standards and thus entrepreneurs in the district and other parts should make effective use of the knowledge provided. He said the entrepreneurs’ products will fetch high value within and outside the market only if they meet the TBS quality standards. “Entrepreneurs who will ignore TBS knowledge on quality standards are set to incur losses in their businesses,” he added. For example, in Kahama District there are more than 21 bakery companies that produce and sell bread to surroundings but when they acquire quality standard mark from TBS, would even sell to a wider market. He said the TBS awareness campaigns carried countrywide to entrepreneurs and other people are currently relevant as the country envisions becoming middle income economy in 2025. TBS Acting Quality Control Director Hamisi Sudi urged entrepreneurs to use the seminar organised by TBS to enhance the value of their products. Mr Sudi said TBS experts have been impressed by the response from entrepreneurs to learn various issues pertaining to quality standards in the country.
