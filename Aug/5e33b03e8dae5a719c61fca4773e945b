PERMANENT Secretary (PS) in the Ministry of Industry and Trade Prof Riziki Shemdoe said recently that a Kaizen approach had saved 300m/- which would have been wasted. Kaizen is a concept referring to business activities that continuously improve all functions and involve all employees from the CEO to assembly line workers. Kaizen is the Sino-Japanese word for improvement. The PS made the remarks during the launch of a national programme for improvement of sustainable profits in the industrial sector for 2020-2030, saying his ministry had discovered the money saved after conducting evaluation in 2019. “We conducted training in industries on the use of the Kaizen approach and managed to save 300m/-,” said the PS during the launch of the programme funded by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). Prof Shemdoe said his ministry had evaluated the implementation of the Kaizen approach, saying it had improved profits and industrial products. He said the government had prepared a 10-year programme to promote the Kaizen approach countrywide, saying this would help develop good strategies to attract other sectors of the economy to utilise the approach. Prof Shemdoe said Tanzania planned to participate in a 16-country competition using the Kaizen approach, saying two Tanzanian industries would participate in the competition to showcase products produced in the country. “The industries should get ready for the competition so that they may bring the trophy to Tanzania,” he said. For his part, Director General for Small Industries Development Organisation (SIDO), Prof Sylvester Mpanduji, noted that SIDO had improved the use of the Kaizen approach to entrepreneurs in their income generating activities. “So far, SIDO in collaboration with JICA has served 56 business clusters in the country and 479 industries which employ 3,978 people,” he said.
