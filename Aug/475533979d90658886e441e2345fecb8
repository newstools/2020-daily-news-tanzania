MULEBA District Council has surpassed its revenue collection target during the 2019/20 fiscal year after collecting 4.66bn/- (equivalent to 127.2 per cent), it has been said. Muleba District Executive Director (DED) Emmanuel Sherembi told the ‘Daily News’ that the target for 2019/20 fiscal year, which ended on June 30, was to collect 3,66bn/-, but the actual collection rose to 4,65bn/-. During the 2020/21 fiscal year, the council targets to collect 5.2bn/-, according to Mr Sherembi. “This is good performance. We are grateful that we surpassed the target. This was due to the cooperation of workers, traders and members of the public in general in revenue collection,” he said. He mentioned the sources of revenue used to reach the target as the presence of four modern abattoirs in Kamachumu, Mubunda, Nshamba and Muleba Urban wards. The council constructed also four large warehouses for the storage of different crops and fishery resources in Goziba, Katembe, Kasenyi and Katunguru wards. Mr Sherembi noted that the council was constructing a car park for large vehicles in Muleba Township and was also revising its bylaws. He mentioned other sources of revenue as fish landing sites, business licences and property tax.
