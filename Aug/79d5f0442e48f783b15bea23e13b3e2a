RESIDENTS have been urged to report any sexual corruption in exchange with service or help. They have been encouraged to be bold and report such cases instead of keeping quiet and protecting the culprits. Manyara Regional Prevention and Combatting of Corruption Bureau (PCCB) Head Holle Makungu said if PCCB got such reports it would take legal action against the leaders involved in sexual corruption, as it was an abuse of office or power. “If you keep quite it means the culprits will continue demanding sexual corruption in exchange with service. This will make you fail to get your rights.” He noted that there were leaders who used their positions to demand sexual corruption which he said was against the law. The appeal comes a few days after PCCB held a Kimana village leader aged 63 years for allegedly asking for a sexual favour from a 23-year-old woman. He said to help the young woman against three people who had grabbed her father’s plot she was asked for a sexual favour. Preliminary investigation shows that the leader knew that the plot belonged to her father, but he was not ready to see that justice being done to the family. “When the young woman saw that it was too much to bear, she reported to a PCCB office and after getting enough information, our officers set up a trap and got him in a room in one of the guesthouse. He had already taken off all his clothes and was still putting on a condom ready to do the criminal act,” said Mr Makungu. The culprit will be arraigned after investigation. In another development, truck drivers who were arrested by PCCB in Simanjiro District for allegedly tax evasion, have entered a plea of guilty and were consequently fined 1,095,250/-. They are alleged to have colluded with a Simanjiro District Council officer.
