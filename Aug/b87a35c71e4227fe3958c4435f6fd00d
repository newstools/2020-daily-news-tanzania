TANZANIA Agricultural Research Institute (TARI) has committed to produce and develop sustainable products which respond to climate change to offset its effects to the sector. Over the years, TARI has developed a number of improved varieties and educated farmers on the right ways of using pesticides in a bid to help farmers stick on modern farming to increase their incomes while overcoming climate change challenges. TARI Director of Research and Innovation, Dr Everina Lukonge said the institution has produced many technologies which address farmers’ challenges, including improved seeds certified by the responsible authority. “In this year’s exhibition, TARI has come up with many technologies, including demonstration plots. We plan to improve the agricultural sector by producing technologies that are in line with the needs of farmers,” Ms Lukonge said. She said farmers should adhere to the directive given by researchers to boost their production and income to overcome poverty. Juma Chenge, a farmer from Kituli village, Tinde ward in Shinyanga region said that the institute technologies help him to increase production of beans, from two sacks to six per year. “TARI helps me to increase my production since I am practicing modern farming technology and using improved seeds and other means to increase yields,” he said. According to TARI, the agricultural sector accounts for merely 30 per cent of the GDP while it employs over 75 per cent of the total population. Tanzania has 94 million hectares, out of which 44 million are suitable for agriculture and only 10.1 million hectares—equivalent to 23 per cent of suitable land—is currently cultivated.
