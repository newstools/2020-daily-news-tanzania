SERENGETI Breweries Limited (SBL) on Tuesday launched an engaging campaign where consumers are set to win cash and other prizes. The campaign comes in just a few weeks after the beer company’s local market is said to have contributed immensely in boosting the East African Breweries Limited (EABL) sales to double digits in the first six months of this year, despite the coronavirus pandemic, while it dropped in Kenya and Uganda. The Tanzania market climbed up to 14 per cent compared to Kenya and Uganda that registered a decline by 14 per cent and 5 per cent, respectively in the same period. Tanzania double digit growth in premium and mainstream beer segments and improved spirits performance supported a strong delivery for EABL this financial year. Thus with the new campaign, the SBL’s Head of Beer, Anitha Msangi said in Dar es Salaam that, “Our Consumers will have the chance to “Serebuka“ by uploading videos of themselves participating in an anthem challenge to win fantastic branded prizes and could also win up to 1m/-cash.” She said the Serebuka anthem will be available for downloading on mdundo, facebook and instagram after which consumers can record their own. Ms Anitha called on all Tanzanians to participate in the campaign and enjoy the best of SBL’s entertainment as they relish the brewer’s brands. SBL currently sources over 70 per cent of raw materials used for its beer production locally, with the current uptake of barley, maize and sorghum soaring to 17,000 metric tonnes per year-and still growing.
