HEALTH officers here have asked the public to continue taking pre-cautionary measures against Covid-19, saying although the spread of the virus has been controlled; risks of a re-surge still exist. “Combined measures and concerted efforts led by our great leaders, Dr John Pombe Magufuli and Dr Ali Mohamed Shein have bared fruits, as we no longer have the panic or anxiety of the disease. But precautions must continue,” health officers said when updating journalists about the pandemic. Mr Issa Abeid Mussa, Assistant Programme Manager, HIV & Tuberculosis programme; and Ms Halima Ali Khamis, Head of health promotion, both from the Ministry of Health, informed journalists that Covid-19 has been controlled, but reminded the public to remain on alert by taking all necessary preventive measures. They asked the public to maintain hand washing, stop stigma, be careful in public gathering, and testing before travelling abroad because in some countries, they require a health certificate on Covid-19 status before entry clearance. They said that Covid- 19 testing is now done in Zanzibar after the purchase and installation of equipment followed by training of staff. “Therefore, travellers requiring coronavirus test certificates should visit our centres after the testing services start by the end of this month. There is no longer any need of taking samples to Dar es Salaam,” said Mr Mussa. At the media Covid- 19 update meeting, Mr Ali Nassor Sultan, a veteran journalist also facilitated a topic ‘Effective reporting on pandemic: Guidelines on reporting pandemic-focus on coronavirus’. Mr Sultan reminded journalists and the media to continue educating members of the public on pandemics and disasters, without using words or language that may cause fear and panic in the country.
