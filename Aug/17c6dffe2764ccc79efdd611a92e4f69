FARM Access Company Ltd based in Dodoma and famous for local veterinary medicines and pesticides production was nurtured by funds from Tanzania Agricultural Development Bank (TADB) as it further rose to become a giant pharmaceutical firm, it has been learnt. Making the revelation at a gathering at the Nzuguni Nane Nane grounds, Deputy Minister for Labour, Youths, Employment and the Disabled, Anthony Mavunde further said: “Let me take this opportunity to thank the TADB for taking major steps in supporting the national industrialization agenda spearheaded by President John Magufuli. “The bank supported the start and growth of the company until it became a giant producing veterinary and farm drugs helping a lot in the country.” Mr Mavunde added that the company broadened its spheres and penetrated the labour market to the extent of employing many young Tanzanians that worth praise. He said that the government would work with the bank towards building several small industries and add value to grapes predominantly grown in Dodoma Region. However, he called upon the TADB to mobilise other banks also to promote grape cultivation and processing in Dodoma Region. On his part, the company’s Senior Development Manager, Dr Simon Mphuru, said they would continue to support the government in raising economic status of smallholder farmers, because they are the primary producers the nation depends on in realizing its national industrialisation drive. In a related development, he appealed to Tanzanians to seize the opportunity and further engage in cultivation of the crop as well as others in the agricultural sector as a source of their livelihood.
