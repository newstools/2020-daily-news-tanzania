AS the country moves to the October General Elections, the ACT- Wazalendo political party Presidential aspirants are urging the media and law enforcers to remain impartial when dealing with political parties. "Your cooperation with political parties has been good, but you need to improveâ€¦we need equal ground for all political parties in the race," Mr Seif Sharif Hamad said, at a short welcome reception at the party offices located at Vuga Street in the City. Mr Hamad who has been endorsed by ACT-Wazalendo to vie for Zanzibar Presidency in the coming elections was accompanied by his counterpart for Union government, Mr Bernard Membe, and other party leaders, who were accorded a warm welcome by fans yesterday on their arrival here. The welcome reception after disembarking from the speed boat from Dar es Salaam included a press conference and a peaceful march from Malindi port along some streets in the City, where fans danced while a considerable number of police officers watched from a distance and similar reception is expected in Pemba today (Monday). At the press conference, Maalim Seif Sharif Hamad and Mr Membe flanked by their running-mate and the party leader Mr Zito Kabwe promised better life for all Tanzanians should they win the October elections. However, the ACT-Wazalendo Presidential aspirants told the cheering fans that the electoral bodies in the country should ensure that the coming elections remain free, and fair.
