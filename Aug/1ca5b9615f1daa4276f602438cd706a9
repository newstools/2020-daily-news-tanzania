THE government, through the Ministry for Health, Community Development, Gender, Elderly and Children, has handed over to Kibaha Town District Council's new hospital (Lulanzi) with an x-ray machine expected to resolve social problems. Before Kibaha residents were forced to walk long distances to other areas to get x-ray services. The hospital is among the 67 district hospitals constructed in five years in the country and is the first one to receive the machine, which has the capacity to serve 200 patients a day. “We have received this machine of high quality and we are very grateful. The machine has already been fixed at our new hospital. This means that Kibaha residents and those from nearby areas will not have to go to Muhimbili National Hospital, Mloganzila or Tumbi Hospital to get services. Instead, they will be able to access all services," said the Council's Public Relations Officer (PRO) Innocent Byarugaba during an interview with this reporter. He said the new hospital was one of the councils’ big achievements in the past five years, adding that it would play a significant role in improving health services. Speaking at Lulanzi Hospital, Kibaha Medical Officer in charge, Dr Sabinus Ndunguru, took time to remind the residents to use the new hospital instead of keep going to Tumbi Hospital or other health centres, saying the new hospital offered important services, including outpatient, reproductive, child health and ultrasound services. Dr Ndunguru noted that the hospital had a modern labour ward and delivery services would start soon. "Our council has no own hospital. Residents from 14 wards used to go to Mkoani Health Centre or Tumbi Hospital,” he said, adding that the new hospital would ease congestion at the two health facilities.
