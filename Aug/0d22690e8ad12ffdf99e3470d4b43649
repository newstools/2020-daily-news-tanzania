MBEYA region is the beneficiary of the play-off matches staged in Mbeya and Mwanza venues after seeing its two teams; Mbeya City and Ihefu winning the high-valued Premier League tickets. As the region will be parading its football supremacy with three teams, together with Tanzania Prisons who firmly remained in the premiership, Mwanza becomes the biggest loser. Mbao were forced to test the First Division League despite their 4-2 win over Ihefu at CCM Kirumba Stadium in a tense encounter. Away goal advantage sent Mbao to the undesired division as the team lost 2-0 to Ihefu in the first leg of the Play-off match at Highland Estate stadium in Mbarali on Wednesday. Ihefu scored two away goals that helped them advance as the results score read 4-4 at the end of the 180 minutes of home and away play-off. Mbeya City, who grabbed the second Premier League ticket, had to sweat profusely to beat Geita Gold 1-0 in a tense match at Sokoine Stadium. The teams drew 1-1 in the first leg match staged at Nyankumbu Secondary School ground in Geita to make 2-1 aggregate winners at the end. Alliance FC who finished 17th on log was the first Mwanza side to part ways with the Premier League. The newly promoted Gwambina is only team from the region that will play in the top flight league next season.
