…Geita collects 13,052kg worth 1.16tr/- in 5 years MAJOR reforms in the mining sector have spurred massive increase in collection of gold, boosting government revenues from the precious metal, Geita Regional Commissioner (RC) Eng Robert Gabriel has said. For the past five years, Geita, a gold-rich region in Tanzania, has managed to collect a total of 13,052kilogrammes of gold worth 1.16tr/-, with the regional government pocketing revenues amounting to a sum of 80bn/-. The RC unveiled the statistics yesterday when he visited the headquarters of the Tanzania Standard (Newspapers) Limited (TSN), publishers of the ‘Daily News’, ‘Sunday News’, HabariLeo, HabariLeo Jumapili, SpotiLeo and Daily News Digital. He said, with the reforms and commitment of government leaders, ‘the hub of gold’ Geita, has been experiencing a sharp increase in gold volume and revenue collection every year, a move that has also contributed to the improvement of social services and the lives of people in the region, while contributing handsomely to the national coffers. “Statistics are bare for everyone to see. In 2016, a total of 337.4 kg of gold worth 28.8bn/- were collected in Geita, where the regional government collected revenues amounting to 1.15bn/-,” he said. According to the RC, in the following year-- 2017 gold collection increased to 832.5kg that were sold at 62.9bn/-, with the region earning 3.4bn/-, noting; “This money can finance construction of two districts, hospitals and one health centre”. The government’s ban on the export of carbon and mineral concentrates in 2018 doubled the amount of gold that were collected, which stood at 1,634kgs worth 125.5bn/-, whereas the region pocketed 8.7bn/- from the collection. RC Gabriel further said that the opening of mineral trading markets in 2019 also played a crucial role in improving the collection as the region collected 26bn/- revenue from 4,656kgs of gold worth 375.5bn/-. “In the year 2020, a total of 5,591kgs of gold worth 576.5bn has been collected so far, and we have been able to pocket 40.3bn,” said the RC, noting, chances are high for the collection to improve before December this year. “The money being raised, according to him, has been channeled to various development projects in the region including construction of the new market, commercial complex, as well as social services mostly covering health and education sectors,” he said. Speaking of the budget targets, Eng Gabriel said in the financial year 2015/16, the government had set the target for the Geita region to collect 50bn/- from its various internal sources, but the region managed to collect 53bn/, being 103 per cent of the projection. “In 2016/17 the target was to collect 55.2bn/- but the actual collection by the end of the financial year stood at 56.8bn/-, while in the following fiscal year, the region was given a target of collecting 50.5bn/-, but it surpassed the target by 227 per cent after raising 114.7bn/-,” he explained. Expounding further, the RC said with the increased collections, the target for 2018/19 hiked to 85bn/- but the final collection stood at 128.9bn/- being a 151.7 per cent of the primary projection, while the 2019/2020 target was to collect 156.34bn whereas the final collections were recorded at 207.7bn/-. He said; “All these achievements aren’t the overnight process, they resulted from hard work, commitment and great reforms that were engineered by President John Magufuli, who took power in November 2015”. “This has also stimulated business and economic activities in the region, as it is now shining compared to the past,” he said, assuring that the regional administration is working hard to improve social services delivery and that by December, this year they will be completing the construction of 100 dispensaries across the region. Also, the regional government has been working closely with investors to ensure the laws of the land are well observed for the greater interests of all parts including the surrounding communities. For his part, the Geita Division Officer, Mr Innocent Mabiki said with the proper implementation of the law, investors have been able to meet their legal obligations by offering their returns to the surrounding communities under Corporate Social Responsibilities (CSR). In July 2017, President Magufuli signed two bills into laws, which means the country’s natural resources are now secured and protected more than ever. The new laws are meant to facilitate the protection of natural resources and safeguard Tanzanians’ welfare in the sector. The two laws that have direct impact to the country’s natural resources include the Natural Wealth and Contracts (Review and Re-negotiation of Unconscionable terms) Act, 2017 and the Natural Wealth and Resources (Permanent Sovereignty) Act 2017.
