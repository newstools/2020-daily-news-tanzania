THE National Institute for Medical Research (NIMR) Board Chairman, Dr Deo Mtasiwa in Dar es Salaam, urged the institute to concentrate on roles, which show tangible improvements in the health sector. “Research is a key issue in improving health and fighting diseases for the development of the country. This institute has been doing a commendable job, but we want to see more improvements towards eliminating some of the diseases in the country and the world at large,” he said, while launching NIMR master workers’ council in the city. Dr Mtasiwa further said such success can be attained only if NIMR embarks on serious coordination of its activities between its management and individual employees in the council. He said NIMR has made tremendous efforts worth praise, but more unifying efforts would still lead it to better results as the State builds for an industrialized economy. Elaborating, the Chairman noted that involving NIMR workers in preparing strategic plans, budgeting and work plans would help the institute to realize more achievements within a short time. “I can assure you that proper coordination through the council will inspire everybody and ensure improvement are made and good results in the health sector seen,” he added. On his part, NIMR Director General Prof. Yunus Mgaya, said that the researches being carried out at the institute have brought numerous changes and successes in fighting diseases, adding that: “The workers’ council will help to speed up research studies. We have successfully managed to conduct researches on malaria, treated mosquito nets, established pesticides industry at Kibaha and many other areas and we are also involved in the research on Covid-19,” said Prof Mgaya.
