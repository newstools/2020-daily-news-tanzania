THE Travel World's News Group has awarded the Tanzania Chamber of Commerce Europe with the Tourism Resilience Seal for its efforts at promoting and sending tourists to Tanzania. The Seal branded 'Safer Tourism' meaning the chamber recognised for its effort of sending tourists in safe destinations even at this difficulty time when the world is fighting the Covid-19 pandemic. The Chamber's Founder and CEO, Ms Edna Lyatuu Hogan, said they have been awarded as an institution for promoting tourism in Tanzania. "We have brought thousands of tourists to Tanzania via our chamber and our partners globally. I couldn't tell the exact figure but it is in thousands," Ms Hogan told the 'Daily News' yesterday. The award was issued last week by Mr Juergen Thomas Steinmetz of the Travel World News in Ireland and received by  Ms Hogan. This cement the early award the country received for safer travel and open more doors of bringing tourists in the country as a safe destination amid coronavirus pandemic. "...At our chamber we promote tourism from high end--very wealthy tourists to mid and low end, like volunteers and international students," Ms Hogan said. Early this month, the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC) gave the country a stamp for implementing safety measures and precaution against Covid-19. Tanzania opened its doors for international travellers since June and reviewed the health guidelines for the foreign visitors late July.
