TANZANIA Cricket Association (TCA) Development League continues this weekend with Kinondoni Development team facing Ilala Boys at Leaders Club ground in Dar es Salaam. The 40-over format league involves five teams whereas four are built from the 19-players while the fifth one is the women side. The youth cricket league was launched by TCA with a purpose of strengthening the U-19 and women squads ahead of the forthcoming international level tournaments. As next year, the youth squad will play the International Cricket Council (ICC) Under-19 African Qualifier Division 2, scheduled to take place in Dar es Salaam. The National Team Head Coach, Steve Tikolo believes that, the establishment of this league is the best chance to build strong and competitive squad in the forthcoming competitions. To ensure that the youth squad is well sharpened, the 22 boys were teamed with senior players in six teams at the Advanced Players League played in 20 overs.
