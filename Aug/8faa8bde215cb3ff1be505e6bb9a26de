THE College of African Wildlife Management Mweka (CAWM-Mweka) has acquired 394 new acres in Loliondo, Ngorongoro District, in Arusha Region. This was revealed by CAWM-Mweka Rector, Prof Jafari Kideghesho, during the launch of the facility’s new board of governors recently. He said the land had been surveyed and procedures to acquire all official documents were underway. “The college’s future plan is to establish a permanent campus in this area and reduce the time and cost of students to travel long distances during practical training which is part of training procedures. “The area, apart from being close to Serengeti National Park, Ngorongoro, Lake Manyara and Lake Natron, which are some of the tourist attractions, it is also rich in flora and fauna. In addition, it provides opportunities to students and teachers to learn and research the history and interactions between humans and wildlife,” he said. The process of acquiring 10 acres near Nyumba ya Mungu in Mwanga District was underway. The area around Nyumba ya Mungu is very important for the college’s training due to the fact that it is famous for migratory birds from European and Asian countries. Speaking during the launch of the new board of governors, Deputy Minister for Natural Resources and Tourism Constantine Kanyasu urged the management to ensure it continued conducting research on wildlife in and outside the country to maintain its status as a centre of excellence in wildlife training. “Make sure you strengthen research and professional advice so that you can address challenges facing the tourism sector in the country. To benefit from technological advancement, it is also important for the college to focus on specific courses on the use of technology in wildlife management and tourism in general,” he said.
