A PROJECT funded by Grand Challenges Canada known as Public Private Partnership for Menstrual Health Management (PPP4MHM) for schools has been availed in Kibaha Town Council for six Secondary Schools, where the girl child as a student would be provided by affordable sanitary pads. Speaking at the project launch at Bundikani Secondary school recently, National Institute for Medical Research (NIMR) acting Director General, Dr Ndekya Urio, said that they partnered with Kasole Secrets Company that would see into it that the pads are affordable to the girls and easily acquired. “This project will first involve supplying 15,000 pads freely to more than 2,000 girls for three months, thereafter, they would be available at affordable price,” she said. Speaking on behalf of fellow students, Saada Shaban, a Form Three student at Bundikani Secondary School, said that the project is a redeemer to them and would assist those who would be tempted to stay at home during their menstrual periods to go to school. “Some of us do fail to attend schools for two days or more when one is in the menstrual period… some are forced to abscond studies, because they lack comfort when in school without pads especially in company of male students, but this will boost our confidence and academic performance,” she said. On her part, Kibaha District Administrative Secretary, Sozi Ngate, assured that her office will offer all needed support for the project to bear fruits. “Access to safe menstruation is still a challenge. With this support from NIMR and Kasole Secrets, sanitary pads will be available at schools and secured from teachers’ office(s) at an affordable price. This will promote learning among girl students,” said Ms Ngate, who represented Kibaha District Commissioner at the ceremony. The project covers Bundikani, Pangani, Simbani, Visiga, Mwambisi Forestry and Kibaha Girls secondary schools in the area.
