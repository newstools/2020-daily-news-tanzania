ABC basketball team regained RBA League’s pilot seat from JKT, after posting massive win over Ukonga Kings over the weekend. Since the league started last month following the government’s order to resume sports in early June, the league was a twoteam show between ABC and the defending champions JKT in a race for the helm. Early Saturday, it was JKT who had a mammoth 104-38 victory over Magnet at the top of the table with 14 points from seven matches. But their place at top only lasted a few hours following ABC’s later Saturday night 66-3 8 victory over Ukonga Kings that helped them to regain their top place with 15 points; however they have a game in hand. Ukonga Kings had mixed results this week as after suffering a defeat from leaders, they went on to beat Magnet 94-45 later on. Magnet are yet to win from seven matches they have played so far. Tyrone Leopord poured in 21 points for winners as Christopher Lyamuya added 13, while Magnet’s Juma Kizinga scored 18 points and Magoti Mtemi added eight points to Magnet. However, the talk of the weekend will remain an encounter between Pazi and Savio. The day saw the third-placed Pazi succumb to 43- 42 defeat from Savio, who left it late to score winning points in the second.
