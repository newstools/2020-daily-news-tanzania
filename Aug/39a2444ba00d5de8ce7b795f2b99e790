EMERC and Dynamic Engineering Company Limited, the company that supplies electricity in Iramba and Mkalama districts, has been in the spotlight as the Rural Energy Board (REB) is dissatisfied with its power projects. Chairman of REB Advocate Julius Kalolo said in a statement issued at the weekend by REB Communications Unit that the contractor had not set up requisite infrastructure for power supply in many rural areas. “We have noted that the contractor has somehow played his part, but many rural areas in Mkalama and Iramba districts have no power,” reads part of the statement. REB is dissatisfied with power supply projects in the rural areas of the two districts after inspection. Thus, REB has directed the contractor to expand a project timeframe to ensure people get electricity by September 10. According to the REB chairman, if the contractor fails to fix the problem of poor progress, the scope of the projects will be reduced for the work to be completed on time. “The contractor will be under supervision for three days and if he doesn’t show any progress, his work will be reduced so that residents may get electricity on time,” he said. For his part, Acting Director of Tanesco Technical Service Jones Olutu said he had directed the contractor to comply with REB directives and warned that if there were no progress, the scope of work would be reduced. “We have warned him that if he does not start working in three days, his scope of work will be reduced,” he noted. Mt Olutu directed the contractor to make use of the rural workforce. Speaking on behalf of the contractor, Mr James Kinyila, who supervises the project in the area, promised to meet the deadline.
