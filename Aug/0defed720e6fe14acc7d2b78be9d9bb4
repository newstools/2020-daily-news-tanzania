HARDLY three days after President John Magufuli promised to facilitate the expansion of the Dumila-Feri road section along Morogoro-Dodoma highway to enable residents in the area to conduct their small businesses in a hygienic environment, authorities in the region have started conducting a feasibility study for the project to kick off. The expansion of the road section will pave the way for the construction of business stalls on both sides of the highway to ensure petty traders engaging in vegetable products do so in a hygienic environment. Preliminaries on the feasibility study started in implementation of the directive the president issued on August 5, during a stopover in the area en-route to Dodoma. Morogoro Regional Administrative Secretary ( RAS) Engineer Emmanuel Kalobelo and his team visited the area yesterday to inspect the ongoing feasibility study. However, he said the feasibility work started shortly after President Magufuli issued the directive. Engineer Kobelo said he directed Kilosa District Executive Director Asajile Mwambambale to seek funds for project implementation from internal sources, instead of waiting for funds from the president’s office. He also directed designers of business stalls to ensure that they are user friendly to all people, including food vendors and bodaboda taxi operators. He said petty traders who are currently conducting businesses there should not be affected by the project upon completion. “ I kindly ask Kilosa residents, especially residents of Dumila, to accord full cooperation to the authorities implementing this project during the entire period,” Engineer Kobelo urged.
