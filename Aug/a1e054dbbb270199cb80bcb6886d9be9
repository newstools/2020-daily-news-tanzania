TANZANIAN international striker, Dickson Ambundo has stated that he may not return to Kenya Premier League champions Gor Mahia, after the expiry of his contract. Speaking with the 'Daily News' yesterday, Ambundo said he was not ready to extend a contract with Gor Mahia popularly known as 'K'Ogalo', due to various reasons. He lamented nonpayment of salaries for the past seven months. "I'm now looking for a possible new challenge elsewhere, this is all due to non-payment of salaries," Ambundo said. The former Nyamagana United, Mbao FC and Alliance FC player further disclosed that he has received several offers from other teams. Ambundo said that he has received a host of offers from Kenya, Tanzania and across Africa. "I have received offers from different clubs and it is just a matter of time before I reveal my next move as clubs in Tanzania, Kenya and Africa are chasing my signature," Ambundo said. Ambundo also said that he is currently engaged in serious individual training for four months now at his home at Nyamagana stadium. Gor Mahia were confirmed as the 2019/20 Kenyan Premier League champions. Kenya premier league stopped due to the Covid-19 pandemic with no definite return date. By the time, K'Ogalo were leading the table with 54 points after playing 23 matches.
