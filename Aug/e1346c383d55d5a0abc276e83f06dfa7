TANZANIA Distilleries Limited (TDL) has expressed its commitment to the development of grape farming in Dodoma Region as well as its ambition of moving to direct contract with local grape farmers. TDL’s contribution to local sourcing and intentions to develop the grape industry is aligned with the government’s efforts to improve the livelihoods of many smallholder farmers and enhance the economy. TDL General Manager Devis Deogratius said the company sourced approximately 1.2 million litres of wine from CETAWICO and UWAZAMAM, whose source local grapes produced in Tanzania. This translates into about 3.3bn/-per annum. TDL strongly believes that Tanzania’s industrial drive can be a success if smallholder farmers are empowered to produce raw materials needed by industries. According to Mr Deogratius, the company is committed to increasing local sourcing throughout its entire value chain over the coming years and currently sources 89 per cent of its materials and services locally which is equivalent to over 46bn/-. TDL has invested in the creation of Tanzanian brands which include: Imagi, Valeur, Dodoma Wines, Dodoma Rose, Konyagi and Zanzi Cream liqueur which are household names and are structured to cater for a wide array of pallets.
