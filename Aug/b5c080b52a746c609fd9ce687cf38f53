Absa Bank Tanzania has said it will keep on supporting the community as its priority along with providing quality services. Absa Bank Tanzania Citizenship Manager Hellen Siria said the commitment was made because Absa Bank was part of the community. “We came from the community and must be supportive of each other,” she said at a handover event of various equipment to girls, who had recently graduated at VETA. At least six selected needy girls attended special training at VETA sponsored by Absa Tanzania under the coordination of PACT Tanzania and Wamata. Some of the courses offered to them were hairdressing, decoration and sewing. It was a PACT’s idea to help those girls acquire special and different training that would support their life. “Thanks to those who sold us such a vital idea which goes parallel to Absa Group’s saying: ‘we bring possibility to life’, now, as we see, we have brought life back to these girls who were about to give it up.” She praised VETA, PACT Tanzania and Wamata for ensuring that graduates continue working as a network, supporting each one’s business, giving them business and life tactics. PACT Tanzania Corporate Engagements Manager, Beatrice Kamugisha, echoed Hellen’s statement, reinstating the institution’s aim to give opportunities to youths. “We are very proud that Absa Bank Tanzania has accepted our request and now we are witnesses of the bright future of these six fortunate youths,” she said. The event was held last week at Wamata offices in Dar es Salaam, while one of the girls thanked all well-wishers who collaborated in assisting them, promising to use what they had acquired for the benefit of society.
