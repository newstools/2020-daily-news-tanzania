BREASTFEEDING mothers have been reminded of their core duty of ensuring that they feed their babies only on mothers’ milk during the initial six months without extra food supplements, to avoid risks for them. Speaking during a media training session linked to World Breastfeeding Week, the Tanzania Food and Nutrition Centre (TFNC) Senior Nutritional Researcher Officer, Ms Gelagister Gwarassa, said breast milk was the only food that a baby needed from birth until the age of six months because it met all the nutrient and water requirements for babies. She said breast milk contains antibodies against diseases and stimulants necessary for brain and body growth, noting that if a baby is introduced to complementary foods before the age of six months, he or she would be exposed to several health risks. Ms Gwarassa said lack of enough antibodies in milk increased the risks of babies contracting diseases such as diarrhoea and respiratory tract infections. “It also increases a child’s risk of developing allergic reactions, including skin and asthma and can lead to malnutrition,” she explained. She added that extra foods for babies increased prospects for them to be protected against contracting non-communicable diseases such as diabetes, kidney problems, high blood pressure and some cancers as they reach adulthood. On the same occasion, TFNC Director of Education and Nutrition, Ms Sikitu Kihingu Simon, said education on the importance of breast-feeding should be provided to the general public, as it was key to enhancing a child’s development in fighting nutrition deficiencies.
