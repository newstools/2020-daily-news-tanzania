MULEBA residents in Kagera Region have thanked President John Magufuli for improving the health sector that enabled Kimeya Health Centre to perform 85 surgeries. Muleba District Executive Director Emmanuel Sherembi told the ‘Daily News’ yesterday that the government three doctors, who had been posted to Kimeya Health Centre recently, performed the surgeries after getting reliable electricity. He said about 45,000 villagers from Kasharunga, Kyebitembe, Kalambi, Kimwani and Mubunda wards were getting medical treatment at the health centre which was recently rehabilitated after receiving 400m/- from the central government. “On behalf of Muleba residents we thank President Magufuli for his efforts in improving the welfare of poor people through improved health services. The availability of essential medicines in health facilities in the district is almost 98 per cent. This is due to the fact that President Magufuli had increased the budget for buying medicines from 31bn/- to 269bn/-. This is a big achievement,” he said. He said from 2015 to 2020 the number of dispensaries also increased to 27 while the number of health centres stood at five - namely Nshamba, Kamachumu, Kaigara, Kimeya and Izigo. Kagera Region recorded significant decrease in Malaria caused deaths by almost 25.3 per cent during a period of three years. Kagera Regional Coordinator of Malaria Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI), Dr Julian Mugengi, noted that in 2015, at least 591 malaria deaths were recorded compared to 150 deaths recorded in 2018.
