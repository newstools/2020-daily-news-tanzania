LEADERS of Manyara Miners Association (Marema) are on a two-week visit to see and speak with artisanal miners in Babati, Mbulu, Hanang', Kiteto and Simanjiro districts. Marema Chairman Justine Nyari said the aim was to inspect mines, the security situation and get to know any challenges the miners were facing and look for the right way to address them. They were also inspecting health and safety, sanitation and environmental conservation. They had also been discussing with stakeholders on the use of dynamites, taxes imposed on them, the legality of licenses they had and identity cards issued to unofficial members and the new ones. Marema Deputy Chairperson Money Yusuf said after inspection they would hold meetings to respond to questions that would be raised and see how they could address the challenges facing them and get advice from small miners. “Our members have been facing different challenges, but some of them violate the law and regulations that regulate mining activities. We have to speak to them regularly to address such issues,” said Mr Yusuf. Marema Secretary General Tariq Seif said they would also visit Manyara Regional Commissioner (RC) Joseph Mkirikiti to familiarise with him and see how they could cooperate in mining activities. “We will also meet with Regional Resident Mineral Officer Godfrey Nyanda who is the guardian of Marema,” he said. For his part, Marema Treasurer Neney Lyimo said their visit would also meet leaders in areas where there were disputes between miners and the Tanzania National Parks Authority (Tanapa). “We are making a follow-up on the disputes between Tanapa and miners - some of them being Mayoka villagers while others include miners and Tarangire National Park and Lake Manyara National Park. Our aim to see that justice is done,” the treasurer said.
