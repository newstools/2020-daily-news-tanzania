THE Football Referees Association of Tanzania (FRAT) has described the just ended FIFA MA referee course as fruitful saying it has helped domestic referees to get extra skills required in their profession. The five-day course climaxed yesterday in Dar es Salaam with the beneficiaries equipped with vital knowledge on how they can successfully manage the beautiful game of football. In his remarks, FRAT chairman Soud Abdi labelled the training as fruitful and that it has given them enough preparations ahead of the 2020-21 Mainland Premier League season. "Most of those who participated are referees in the top flight league as such, they have gained extra skills on what they should do to manage the games smoothly when the new season begins," he said. He also said the course was a contest for some of the referees who fought hard to qualify for FIFA badges next year. Again, Abdi disclosed that during the training, the attendees where provided with various video clips of actions during matches for them to identify what sort of mistake was done and the appropriate action to be taken. "They were also taught on how to position themselves better as the game unfolds plus the proper ways to spot offsides," he narrated. According to him, the course was run by FIFA physical and technical instructors via online mode of teaching. He then heaped praises on the big number of turnout for those who came to be drilled so as to upgrade their understanding of football to avoid making silly mistakes. In a related development, the Tanzania Football Federation (TFF) yesterday announced that seminar for the top flight league referees will be held from tomorrow up to August 31st. On the other hand, the seminar for the First Division League (FDL) and Second Division League (SDL) will be staged from September 18th to 22nd this year.
