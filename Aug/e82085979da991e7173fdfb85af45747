PHARMACISTS have been advised to tap any potential opportunity in their midst that would also employ other people, besides offering services in the community. The call was made here recently by the Government Chief Pharmacist (CP), Daud Msasi, at the 8th ceremony organised to admit and register new pharmacists, adding that the profession requires integrity, ethics and trust to deliver to the public. In the course, about 109 news pharmacists were certified by the Pharmacy Council, at the ceremony that was attended by various officials from the Ministry of Health, Community Development, Gender Elderly and Children. Mr Msasi, who also doubles as Pharmaceutical Services Director in the ministry reminded the newly staff to concentrate on obligations, which serve the community. “I want you to be problem-solvers instead of creating problems, in this regard, use your professionalism to serve the community,’’ he urged. In a related development, the Director pointed out that currently, there was a problem of some drugs becoming resistant and do not cure diseases, hence, asked them to solve the problem. He said since the government lays emphasis on creativity and innovation among the youth to bring changes at workplace, it was upon the pharmacists to take the lead. Commenting, the Pharmacists Board’s Registrar, Elizabeth Shekalaghe, urged the certified pharmacists to offer better services to patients and maintain the respect they have in public. According to her, with the admission of 109 new pharmacists, the country now has about 2079 pharmacists.
