 DAR ES SALAAM Catholic Archbishop Jude Thaddeus Ruwa'ichi has urged Tanzanians to vote for the right candidates who would be able to lead them to a better future.  He gave the advice shortly after the ordination of two priests which took place at Mavurunza parish in Dar es Salaam  yesterday. "Tanzanians ought to bear in mind that they are going to elect people who will lead them for the next five years; this should be taken seriously to ensure they make right decisions through ballot boxes,” he said. He said the voters must vote for candidates who are ready to preserve peace, integrity and justice for all wananchi. "People should not vote basing on political affiliations, but on listening and analyzing arguments from the candidates; we need leaders who are able to effect positive changes for the people’s benefits,” he remarked. Archbishop Ruwaichi also called for the youth to use social media responsibly by not involving themselves in immoral contents which are of negative impacts to their lives and that of others.
