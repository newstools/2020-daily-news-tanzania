THE National Electoral Commission (NEC) has rejected two objections against nominations of Chama cha Mapinduzi and CUF Presidential candidates. Yesterday, Chama cha Demokrasia na Maendeleo (CHADEMA)'s flag-bearer for the Union presidency election, Tundu Lissu submitted his objections against CCM’s Dr. John Magufuli and Prof Ibrahim Lipumba (CUF). In his objections, Lissu claimed that Prof Lipumba didn’t return nomination forms as per Commission's regulations and Dr Magufuli didn’t attach photo in his nomination forms. Delivering the ruling, NEC’s director of elections, Dr Wilson Mahera said that basing  on the evidences submitted to the Commission, Lissu’s claims were baseless. However, NEC said the duo remains legal candidates for Union Presidency.
