BARELY a week after Kenya opened its airspace for international flights, the national carrier Kenya Airways has suspended flights to eight destinations in the continent. In a statement sent to newsrooms, Kenya Airways said that the drastic decline in revenues has had an effect on the airline’s ability to continue operations. “We will, however, continue to offer connections to our network via the Nairobi hub through our partners,” said the airline in a statement Luanda, Mogadishu, Khartoum and Maputo are some of the routes axed from the carrier’s roster. Others are Brazzaville, Khartoum, Blantyre and Bamako.
