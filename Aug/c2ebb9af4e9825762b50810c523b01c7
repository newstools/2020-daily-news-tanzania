THE 754.4m/- water project implemented in Chalinze, Bagamoyo District in Coast Region has started benefiting residents of Talawanda village in the district, most of them expressing joy for the service they have been longing for years. Implemented under Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Agency (RUWASA), the project is part of the government’s efforts to ensure that rural populations get access to clean and safe water. Speaking during the handing over ceremony in the village on Thursday, Bagamoyo District Administrative Secretary (DAS) Ms Kasilda Mgeni thanked the government for facilitating the project. She urged the villagers to take proper care of water infrastructures. “Our government has spent a huge amount of money to accomplish this project so that you can have reliable water services within your reach. You are now supposed to show appreciation by taking good care of these infrastructures so that they last long,” she remarked. She warned that any acts of sabotage would not be tolerated and that stern measures would be taken against those who would tamper with the infrastructure. RUWASA’s Acting Manager for Chalinze Council, Eng Christina Mrisho, said that the project which started in 2014 was implemented by MS Sife General Enterprises Co. Ltd and was jointly supervised by Bagamoyo District Council and Consultant Inter Consult Co. Ltd. She cited nine water access points that had been built in the four localities in Talawanda village as Talawanda (3), Ludiga (2), Msanga (2) and Vundumu (2). Earlier, Ms Mgeni, in the company of RUWASA Acting Manager for Bagamoyo Council Eng. James Kionaumela inspected another water project worth 44m/- at Yombo Village. “The source of this project is a borehole. So far the project has reached about 90 per cent of its implementation. The next step is for Dar es salaam Water and Sewarage Authority ( DAWASA) to make connections so that people can start using the water, “ he said.
