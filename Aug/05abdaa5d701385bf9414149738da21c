TATA Africa Holdings Tanzania has awarded 47 passenger and cargo drivers one-year life insurance as a way of motivating other companies to recognise the sector. The drivers, according to Tata, despite their importance to society have been neglected and left in despair while they need a life cover. The firm, dominated in commuter buses and delivery van market, also said they wanted the drivers too to cultivate a culture of insuring themselves. Tata Africa Holdings Tanzania Country Head Rajiv Bhushan said insurance cover wa for one year and after that they might either renew or select a fresh group, but wanted others to join the bandwagon. “Tata Tanzania is one of the companies that have seen a need to enrol the drivers in the scheme. This is the first scheme globally and we have started with 47 drivers, who drive Tata vehicles in various companies such as beverage companies,” Mr Bhushan said. The director added that although the drivers working very hard to transport passengers and cargo they were not given due attention by vehicle owners. Alliance Insurance Chief Executive Officer Byford Mutimusakwa said the premium covered education for beneficiaries and also funeral services for holders. “The insurance ensures that these drivers benefit from packages in the event of death,” Mr Mutimusakwa noted. He also said if a driver had an accident which would result in a permanent disability, he would continue being paid until he died. Tata Motors Group is a $45bn organisation.
