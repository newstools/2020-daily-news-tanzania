PLANS are in place to review the Cooperative Development Policy, 2002, and come up with a new one that copes with the current environment in their operations. This was revealed by the Tanzania Cooperative Development Commission (TCDC) Director of Planning and Evaluation, Buji Bampebuye, recently while meeting some stakeholders to collect views before drafting the new policy. The meeting brought together farmers, representatives of various groups, private sector and Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs), among others. However, Mr Bampebuye noted that the review was aimed at ensuring that it aligns with the current situation of the cooperatives and addresses all their important issues. “Let us use this opportunity to discuss together, air out our views and as well offer our recommendations on how to improve the policy and come up with the final draft that would add value to our cooperative unions,’’ he said. Presenting a topic at the meeting, a Law lecturer at Moshi-Cooperative University (MoCU), Alphonce Mbuya, ran the participants on the history of the Cooperative Development Policy, 2002, and various documents regarding its establishment. On the review of the policy, Mr Mbuya said it had considered the Five-Year National Development Plan 2016/17-2020/21, CCM Manifesto 2015/2020, UN Agenda 2030, Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), The Agriculture Policy 2013, The Cooperatives Policy (2013) and other several documents that were considered necessary. Equally, the topic aimed at looking on the assessment of 2002 policy implementation, and achievements that had so far been obtained and related challenges.
