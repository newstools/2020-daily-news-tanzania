A BOOKING process for sea ferry travellers from Dar es Salaam to Zanzibar has been made simple, thanks to partnership between Tigo Tanzania and Vigor Group of Companies, the owners of ZanFast Ferries. Through this initiative, passengers will be able to purchase ferry tickets using Tigo Pesa. Tigo Acting Chief Officer for Mobile Financial Services Angelica Pesha said, “Tigo welcomes this partnership because they add value to our existing services.” She said from today travellers would get their tickets easily by paying through Tigopesa at their own convenience. “We urge our customers to utilise this service to save time and make their payment process easy.” Tigo customers will need to download ZanFast Ferries App then go to a booking office, book a ticket then select Tigo Pesa and proceed to pay. Vigor Group Managing Director Toufiq Turky said the company was proud of partnering with Tigo Pesa through a fully-fledged financial system that was convenient and user-friendly and could be accessed from anywhere, thus ensuring reliable transport services to all customers. “Alongside our ZanFast App, we have now added Tigopesa to our payment platforms to offer our customers with more options to purchase tickets across the country to ensure flexibility in bookings,” he said. ZanFast Ferries is one of the investors in the marine transport through its high-speed boats contributing significantly to the improvement of transport services for both local and international travellers taking the Zanzibar-Dar es Salaam route.
