BUSINESS Registration and Licensing Agency (BRELA) is offering instant business registration services to farmers and livestock keepers at  the farmers’ fair in Simiyu. The Agency said they embarked on the service in order to ease and educate farmers and livestock keepers on the importance of registering their businesses. BRELA’s Trader Officer Mr Paul Peter urged farmers and pastoralists in the region and its suburbs to take advantage of the exhibition opportunities to access the service at Nyakabindi grounds in Bariadi Township. "I urge farmers and pastoralists in the region to use the opportunity to obtain a business licence,” Mr Peter said. He said the licence will not only enable them to conduct their businesses freely but also expand their market scope. Also, the Agency advised pastoralists to ensure that  they are registered first with Tanzania Meat Board before seeking BRELA licenses. "BRELA is here to provide free services of registration to eliminate inconveniences,” Mr Peter said. BRELA has developed  a modern Online Registration System (ORS) that comprises registration of companies, business names, trade and service marks and their respective post registrations, issuance of patents and industrial licenses. The system enables customers to access all BRELA services wherever they are without visiting the Agency premises, at any time of the day. BRELA regulates Business Licenses Act of 1972, which was amended in 2002 and has two categories A and B.
