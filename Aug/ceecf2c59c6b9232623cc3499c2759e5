THE Automobile Association of Tanzania (AAT) said that safety measures to drivers and spectators will be stricter this time despite the country’s success in combating coronavirus scare. Speaking in an occasion to launch of Safe Driving campaign in Dar es Salaam, the association’s president Nizar Jivani said AAT under the guidance of the safety measures recommended by the World motorsports governing body(FIA) will strictly observe all safety measures in all motor rallies while as well observing safety directives against coronavirus. According to Jivani, the implementation of the new safety measures, which he labelled foolproof will be first applied in Iringa, the venue of the second round of the National Rally Championship (NRC 2) on September 18th and 19th this year. “We are obliged to strictly observe safety guidelines against road accidents and that of coronavirus because both are vital for the lives of drivers and spectators,” he explained. The foolproof safety measures, according to AAT boss will be tested again in Arusha on November 6th during the third round of the National Rally Championship before winding up the exercise during the final round of NRC to be hosted by Mzizima Club of Dar es Salaam on December 12th and 13th this year. However, Jivani said the biggest task for his body is crowd control in the sections, but he and his team will ensure social distancing is strictly observed in all the three remaining rallies. The safety campaign for all motorists has been implemented globally and here in Tanzania was implemented during the tour of the President of the Automobile Association Federation (FIA) Jean Todt, whose maiden visit to Tanzania set a trailblazer of hope in war against road carnage. The tour was part of the implementation of the United Nations’ Decade of Action plans that aim to reduce the number of deaths by over fifty per cent by 2020.
