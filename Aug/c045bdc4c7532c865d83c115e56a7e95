SUMA-JKT Managing Director, Brigadier General, Rajabu Mabele, has asked Parliament of Tanzania employees currently undergoing a one-month National Service Training to observe patriotism and discipline and replicate them once graduating out of the course. On Tuesday about 41 employees of the legislative body kicked off their four weeks training dubbed ‘Operesheni Uchumi wa Kati’ that was officially opened by Brigadier General Mabele. The SUMA-JKT Managing Director, who graced the training on behalf of the Head of National Service Major General Charles Mbuge, said there was a need for the public servants, who did not attend the compulsory national service training to at least attend the course for one month to reinforce their patriotism and nation building. Elaborating, he asked all the 41 employees of the National Assembly to ensure that they respect orders issued to them by their trainers, saying that whatever instructions they give are part and parcel of the military training. “I believe after this training you will be ambassadors of your colleagues in your offices in intensifying hard work, patriotism, discipline and ethics,’’ insisted Brigadier General Mabele. Speaking at the occasion, the Head of Training and Operation, Colonel Aisha Matanza said that during the one month training, recruits will be taken through weapons’ training, citizenship and patriotism, military drill, internal security and body fitness, among others.
