EXIM Insurance Advisers Limited has started implementing the ‘Endesha na Bima Maisha’ programme that aimed at offering life insurance to TATA drivers in different companies that operate in Tanzania. The ‘Endesha na Bima Maisha’ programme had been introduced by Exim Insurance and ventured by TATA Africa Holdings Tanzania and Alliance Life Assurance to offer life insurance to TATA drivers. Exim Insurance CEO Amitava Biswas said life insurance aimed at insuring the safety of heavy trucks drivers and their families. “Endesha na Bima Maisha” insurance covers funeral services once the driver dies by contributing 1m/- to the family for funeral services.” He added that children’s education would also be taken care of by the insurance cover. The company valued the support and an important role played by these drivers to their employers for handling heavy trucks that transported goods in and outside the country. “Despite their crucial support, the majority of them are not insured. There are different factors which are obstacles for them to be insured. After listening to challenges facing some of the drivers, we as insurance gurus came up with the idea of offering this insurance cover to 47 TATA drivers as a sample.” He explained that they met with TATA Tanzania Holding Company and Alliance Life Insurance and agreed to find the 47 drivers who worked in different companies that used TATA vehicles. “After launching it last Saturday, today we have started offering this product, hoping to reach as many drivers as possible in the country,” he said. Exim Insurance Advisers Limited is responsible for offering life insurance.
