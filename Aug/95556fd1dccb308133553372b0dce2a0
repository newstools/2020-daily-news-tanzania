THE High Court of Tanzania has convicted two Bukoba residents of murder and sentenced them to death by hanging. They are Aliyu Dauda Hassan (36) from Kemondo in Bukoba Rural District and Rashid Mzee Athuman (29) from Rwamishenye Ward in Bukoba Municipal Council. However, co-accused Ngesela Keya Ismail (24) from Rwamishenye Ward in Bukoba Municipal Council was set free for lack of evidence against him. Principal State Attorney Hashim Ngole assisted by State Attorneys Juma Mahona and Grey Uhagire told the High Court during the hearing of the murder case that on the night of March 9, 2015 the two men killed Herman Gridi from Kitendaguro Village, a few kilometres from Bukoba Town. Detective Cpl Justin, who testified as the second eyewitness (PW2), told the High Court that two people were killed at same night and he was assigned to investigate the killings. He told High Court Judge Sam Rumanyika that on March 9, 2015 at 9.30pm he received instructions to go to Kitendaguro Ward, a few kilometres from Bukoba Town where a man, identified as Herman Gridi was killed by unknown people. He said as detectives were examining the body, he received another call and rushed to Kanoni Hamlet, where he found another body. “The killings, most of which victims had their throats cut, causing a lot of panic among Kagera residents, were linked to superstitious beliefs”, he further said. Judge Rumanyika ruled that the prosecution proved the case beyond a reasonable doubt and cautioned statements were given voluntarily.
