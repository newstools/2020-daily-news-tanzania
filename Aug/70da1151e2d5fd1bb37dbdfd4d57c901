JOURNALISTS have been reminded to uphold the common standards of journalism ethics, including remaining impartial at this time of promoting unity and political tolerance ahead of the general elections. The advice was issued here by ‘Magharib A District’ Administrative Council Director, Mr Amour Ali Mussa when he graced over the Zanzibar Press Club (ZPC) general meeting, where the club’s new leaders were elected. Members of the club elected new officers who will steer its affairs for the 2020/25 period. The elections were conducted on Sunday with support from the Union of Tanzania Press Clubs (UTPC). Mr Mussa said there is need for journalists to avoid engaging or fuelling conflicts by adhering to professionalism. “Avoid sensational publications and fictitious stories. Journalists must commit to delivering verified and unbiased information from different sources. They should also refrain from publishing stories that may cause hatred among people and incite violence,” he said.
