THE Katavi Regional Medical Officer (RMO), Dr Omary Sukari has warned men to refrain from the bad habit of suckling milk from their female partners because it denies babies sufficient milk from their mothers. He said the behaviour may cause malnutrition to the infants since they do not get enough milk as required. The RMO made such remarks during the climax of World Breast Feeding Day which was observed along with World Nutrition Day held at regional level in the small town of Inyonga in Mlele, Katavi region. A cross section of adult men who were interviewed admitted to practicing such habits, saying it helps them to regain energy after taking too much alcohol. World Health Organisation (WHO) and the United Nations Children Fund (UNICEF) recommended that children should initiate breast feeding within the first hour of birth, and be exclusively breast fed for the first six months of life. “This means that no other food or liquid should be provided to the infants, including water...... Infants should be breastfed on demand ...that is as often as the child wants, day and night, to achieve optimal growth, development and health. Thereafter they should be given nutritious complimentary foods and continue breast feeding up to the age of two years or beyond. “Worst still, there are mothers who refuse to initiate breastfeeding to their newly born babies during the first hour of birth, arguing that the first milk is dirty and unhealthy for the consumption of infants,” noted the RMO. According to Dr Sukari, breast feeding lowers a mother’s risk of high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes and breast and ovarian cancers
