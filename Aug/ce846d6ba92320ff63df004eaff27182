Weekly outlook IN the coming week, the outlook remains optimistic, however, wary of the low participation of the Foreign investors, since their low participation affect the market with high sentiment. The price discovery challenge will still hinder local investors who are looking to sell Foreign preferred and in active counters at the market price. In the Domestic market the market price movements and turnovers are expected to be in the following counters CRDB, DSE and NICOL which are the most liquid counters in the market. During the week, the market closed firmer after slightly upward movement in DSEI, TSI and B&F index mainly due to mixed movements in share price of Kenyan listed companies and upward share price movement in locally listed active counters. The total market size increased by 30.20bn/-, while domestic market capitalization increased by 13.40bn/-. In midweek we expect Treasury bill auction to be held by the central bank. We may see oversubscription of the Treasury bill due to the higher appetite for Government securities despite the declining yields on Government securities.  Furthermore, the Government securities yield curve will continue to remain normal, with downward movements in the weighted average yields. In the interbank money market, notwithstanding the decrease in the weighted average rate (WAR) during the previous week, we still anticipate that WAR to be within a range of 3.00 per cent to 3.50 per cent with slight volatility in the high and low rate.
