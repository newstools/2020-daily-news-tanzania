HISTORY of the world and creation of different landforms and creatures may not be written correctly without putting special attention to Tanzania, from being the cradle land of mankind, The United Republic of Tanzania is one of few places in the world which is believed to be the home of earliest creatures including Dinosaurs. Most scientists believe things started about 10 billion years ago during the big bang which lead the planet Earth to come into existence about 4.5 billion years ago, then about 3.5 billion years ago a cloud with rain from Mars brought the first showers on this only habitable planet in the universe. On other side religious people believe that this was possible about 3.5 billion years ago when the almighty God accumulated the water mass in one place and named it ocean and enabled life to thrive on the planet Earth, Ocean and sea is what scientists today call Biosphere to represent the liquid mass which occupies more than 71% of the Earth’s surface. Scientist believe that the biosphere came after the Earth became cooler after the decrease of hot waves from the core centre and attracted a rainy cloud from neighbouring planet Mars which is located between 54.6 and 225 million kilometres away from the world, and this lead into the emerging of Lithosphere or dry land with fertile soil which supports lives of plants, animals and microorganisms. According to different fossils records Mesosaurus were the first animals to inhabit the Earth, these prehistoric crocodiles were found in different parts of modern African continent including Tanzania, Nile crocodiles are one of oldest creature to inhabit the planet Earth about 200 million years ago at the time when Dinosaurs were ruling the tropical forest of the Earth. Geologists say its very interesting that unlike Olduvai gorge which is well known all over the world, Tendaguru a small village in Lindi rural district is one of the first places in the world where dinosaurs used to dwell, dinosaurs evolved on Earth more than 243 million years ago and managed to conquer rainforest and savannah when a mass extinction killed other creatures. Scientific researches indicate the southern part of Tanzania attracted dinosaurs from different parts of the world including Asilisaurus which evolved more than 244 million years ago, historians and scientists named this specie by using a Swahili name which indicates the original of dinosaurs in the world to be Tendaguru in southern Tanzania. This shows that Nyasasaurus evolved about 243 million years ago in southern Tanzania while Nundasuchus, a group of dinosaurs occupied the plains on the side of lake Nyasa from about 241 million years ago while the noticeable individual appeared in Manda about 240 million years ago on a body which stretched from two to seven metres. Being one of big centre of evolution process about 153 million years ago another specie named Ceratosaurus roamed in forest and plains of Tendaguru, about 150 million years ago the same place was happy to welcome Giraffatitan one of the largest specie of dinosaurs which an individual is measured about 22.5 metres and stood more than 12 metres tall. History shows that continental drift which happened about 175 million years ago forced some dinosaurs to stay in one place, others were hunted by other dinosaurs and forced into extinction, scientists say volcanic eruptions and asteroid attacks killed all dinosaurs on the Earth’s surface about 66 million years ago and opened doors for humans and other mammals to rule the world. Today Nile crocodiles dwell in river and lakes of 21 countries in Africa including Tanzania where the strongest population of 80,000 is believed to flourish in Selous game reserve while other national parks like Serengeti, Katavi, Rubondo Island and Saadani have a good number thanks to conservation policies by the government. History tells us that Africa came into being about 150 million years ago due to what scientists describe as continental drift but from that time to date this continent has become an important refuge for different species of avian, reptile and mammals. The history of the world shows that, the East African Rift Valley is a part of the Great Rift Valley which stretches for about 6,000 kilometres from Jordan through Ethiopia, Kenya and Tanzania to Mozambique from about 40 million years ago when nature flexed its muscles to different parts of the world including what is known today as East Africa. Geological history shows that the actual formation of Lake Victoria took place about 400,000 years ago when a powerful earthquake rocked this part of Africa, this happened when volcanic activities from the East African Rift Valley created walls by an up throw of surrounding rocks which blocked all rivers which passed through and created several lakes which later were joined together by another volcanic activity. History shows from more than 5.3 million years ago, as a remnant of ancient river systems which flowed around the lake zone, Kagera river is the major source of Nile river, starting from the northern shores of Lake Victoria, Nile flows more than 6,853 to empty its massive water into the Mediterranean Sea after crossing Uganda, Southern Sudan, Sudan and Egypt. On the other hand, scientists say before 541 million years ago when the world was occupied with one super continent, the original lakes which later formed Victoria had one of their sources from Lake Tanganyika, scientific researches indicate that volcanic activities on the western branch of East African Rift Valley blocked the supply when Vurunga mountain emerged and diverted the river southward. Found along the East African Rift Valley, Lake Tanganyika is the deepest lake in Africa and holds the greatest volume of fresh water it holds about 18% of the world’s available fresh water while extending 676 kilometres while covering 32,900 square kilometres with a mean depth of 570 metres and a maximum depth of 1,470 metres, scientists say about 12,000 years ago this lake was connected by a good network of ancient rivers with other water bodies such as lake Nyasa and Rukwa. Scientists estimate the age of lake Nyasa is about 40,000 years and it was formed from the opening of the East African Rift which divided the African tectonic plate into two pieces. Miraculously Lake Tanganyika holds more than 325 different species of cichlid and non cichlid fish including electric eel which is capable of generating harmful currents measuring about 860 watts capable of outsmarting any predator including chimpanzee of Mahale, Gombe and other animal sanctuaries on the shores of Lake Tanganyika. History shows that, even before the arrival of the Bantu from central Africa, about 2.5 million years ago when ancestors of humans and apes took different ways from a common ancestor, chimpanzee migrated deeply into the rims of East Africa Rift Valley where they dwell today inside Gombe and Mahale national parks. Across the world there are about 8,000 different species of electric eel which are estimated to be 28% of all known species of fish in the world and 68% of freshwater dwellers, an electric eel or electric fish has elongated cylindrical body which grows up to 2 metres which enable the snakelike fish to weigh about 20 kilogrammes for healthier adult individual. History tells us that from about 3,000 years ago when the Bantu people started to migrate into Tanzania where they arrived on the shores of Lake Tanganyika between six and eight hundred years ago, fishermen from the Waha community were confronted by the electric eel which attacked them with powerful electric shocks and made the Bantu to name the lake Nyika in recognition of their strength. Meanwhile about 30 million years ago when the East African Rift Valley stretched itself to the area which is known today as Kenya where through it contributed into the formation of Mount Kenya from about 3 million years ago, this happened after crossed to Tanzania about 12 million years ago when tensional forces created faults which made the eastern arm or what is known to some scientists as Gregory Rift. Geological researches indicate about 3.5 million years ago, huge tremors made by volcanic activities around the East African Rift Valley which caused the collapse of an ancient volcanic mountain in Ngorongoro that had five peaks with the tallest standing more than 5,900 metres above sea level. Scientific researches indicate the first layer of volcanic lava which created the base of Mount Kilimanjaro was put in place one of the earliest volcanic activities in the region which happened between 1.9 and 2.5 million years ago with its epicenter on the modern Shira plateau. About 1.9 million years ago the East African rift valley continue to play a key role on the formation of volcanic mountain when it made 80.4 kilometres long fracture which enabled molten lava to create pressure with eruption which pushed part of the Earth’s crust skywards, creating the Shira volcano, the oldest peak on Mount Kilimanjaro. The East African Great Rift Valley made another impact when it brought huge pressure on the Earth’s crust which caused gigantic volcanic eruption that set the base of both Mawenzi and Kibo between 486,000 and 1, 000, 000 years ago. Geologists say the last major volcanic activity on Mount Kilimanjaro happened about 100,000 years ago when subterranean pressure forced Kibo to erupt several times which pushed the summit into its maximum height of 5,900 above the Indian sea level. rstanslaus@yahoo.com
