DEPUTY Commissioner of Police (DCP) in charge of Finance and Logistics Dhahiri Kidavashari has warned trouble makers and politicians who plan to incite chaos during election campaigns to abandon such plans because the Police Force is well-prepared. DCP Kidavashari gave the warning while inspecting the preparedness of different police units at Nshambya on the outskirts of Bukoba Municipal Council. “Tanzanians must ensure that the forthcoming general election is held in a peaceful environment and ensure each person continues with their work after the election. As the October general election approaches Tanzanians should be on guard and report people who want to plunge the country into chaos,” he said. He added that Tanzania was a peace loving country. “For many decades people have lived in peace and harmony. We (the police) will not allow few selfish politicians to disrupt peace. This is a clear message to everybody,” he emphasised. He explained that political leaders were allowed to address rallies, but they should respect laws and regulations and guidelines put in place by the National Electoral Commission (NEC).
