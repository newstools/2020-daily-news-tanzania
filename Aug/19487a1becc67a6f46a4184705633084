THE community has been asked to continue promoting Covid-19 preventive measures, which keep it off as people go about their businesses. Speaking during a one-day seminar to journalists on how they can protect themselves from the pandemic, Dr Francis Lutalala who represented Dodoma Regional Medical Officer said that although there were no reported cases of Coronavirus in the country, it was important for the public to continue observing pieces of advice issued by health experts. Dr Lutalala said all precaution measures that were used to fight Covid- 19 infections need to be sustainable as they help to get rid of the ailment including cholera. “When we were battling Covid-19 a lot of emphasis was made to ensure that people maintain cleanliness by frequently washing their hands. This helps us to get rid of other diseases that come because of dirt,’’ he pointed out. However, he urged journalists to continue taking precautionary measures as they meet different people in the course of their duties. According to him, the environment in which journalists work should ensure they consider all pieces of advice and observe guidelines issued by health officials for them to remain safe and protect their families as well. “You should make sure that you wash your hands regularly and use hand sanitisers, because I know that when you are performing your duties, you meet a lot of people and shake hands,” pointed out the medic. Apart from protecting themselves, Dr Lutalala urged reporters to continue educating the community so that people continue taking all necessary precautions against the disease.
