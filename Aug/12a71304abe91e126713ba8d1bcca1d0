LACK of own accredited laboratory is allegedly impeding Zanzibar Bureau of Standards’ (ZBS) efforts to protect the islanders from consumption of substandard products. “We are striving to ensure that only high quality products, be they imports or domestically produced, are sold in Zanzibar markets but in the absence of our own laboratory, the job becomes tough,” ZBS Inspection and Quality Assurance Officer Hamad Juma Khatib said. Speaking at Zanzibar’s third Nanenane exhibitions at Chamanangwe grounds, the officer also cited the country’s porous borders as another serious challenge in the enforcement of product standards. “Zanzibar is an island with many official and unofficial entry points, it’s not easy to monitor and control all goods that enter the country, especially those smuggled through illegal entries,” he said. Mr Hamad said the country’s standard watchdog has been conducting impromptu searches to detect and impound substandard products from the market. The officer implored all Zanzibaris to support the fight against substandard products in the market by consuming only ZBS approved goods. “If all wananchi decide to snub shoddy products by consuming only goods with ZBS quality mark, even dealers in inferior items will automatically refrain from the business,” argued the officer. ZBS controls product quality using Zanzibar standards, issuance of standard certificates for standards from outside Zanzibar and standard approval for imports.
