PLANS are afoot for the Tanzania Chamber of Commerce, Industrial and Agriculture (TCCIA) to establish a major cluster for the production of chicken and eggs in Dodoma Region. The ambitious initiatives to be implemented in the country’s capital city will also involve the establishment of a special department for the additional value chain of the popular consumed stuff. The envisaged plans, according to TCCIA’s regional director, Idd Senge, is to install a number of modern incubators, and a special unit for chicken rearing and eggs production, as well as a centre for slaughtering and attaining additional value chains for the produced chickens. “We have decided to come up with the idea to implement this project after realizing presence of acute shortage of availability of chickens and eggs in the capital city, being propelled by rapid increase in human population,” he expressed. He noted that the capital city was experiencing an increase in the number of hotels, lodges, restaurants and other food selling facilities, a situation which has automatically pushed for rapid demand for chicken meat and eggs. Moreover, he detailed that, basing on the fact that the region was currently harbouring key populations and with reputable statuses, it was of prudent for professional production and marketing of chicken meat, with an eye to ensure for safety and sanitation. “Despite the impressive trend over improved demand for chicken meat and eggs, most of the chickens are still being slaughtered and prepared poorly, without observing health precautions.” “This project eyes to ensure for mass production of chickens and eggs in order to quench the on-going thirst, but also, to assure for professional slaughtering of the chickens,” he observed. He added, the project will involve opening of a vast super market, specific for selling chicken meat, as well as other related items.
