THE Tanzania Commission for Science and Technology (Costech) has expressed its commitment to supporting startup innovators and communities across Tanzania for local and international investment. Director of Centre for Development and Technology Transfer and Innovation at Costech, Dr Salha Mohammed Kassim, said through the support programme the youth would have an opportunity to boost their talents to achieve their goals. The support programme is implemented in some Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) under Southern African Innovation Support (SAIS). According to her, Costech has supported the establishment of other innovation spaces in different regions, including Mara, Arusha, Mwanza, Tanga, Iringa and Mbeya. She added these hubs were committed to supporting startups, innovators and communities in their regions. â€œWe selected four startups after pitching, then the SAIS will interview the four and two will be selected to represent Tanzania on the final bootcamp and competition. Our aim is to build their capacity and network for international investment," Dr Kassim said. She said this year due to Covid-19, winners would participate in an online boost up bootcamp and pitch to investors. Tanzania winners will represent us in pitching competition, with other startups from South Africa, Botswana, Namibia and Zambia, and winners will receive further support from investors. We have startup activities in form of bootcamp training and organising a delegation trip to a startup conference slush in Finland for selected impact driven startups 2017, 2018 and 2019 where startups were able to participate in a global impact accelerator and meet different investors. Since 2017, Tanzania has managed to offer this opportunity to four startups. Hub Manager from Costech Patience Abraham said Tanzania was among the focal point countries, which implemented Southern African Innovation Support to support the youth to achieve their goals.
