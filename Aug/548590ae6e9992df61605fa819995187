THE Kalambo District Magistrates’ Court in Rukwa Region has sentenced Ester Mwaniwasa to serve a one-year suspended sentence after he was found guilty of  slashing the male sexual organ of her son aged three days. The mother of four is from Katuka Village in Kalambo District. She committed the offence using a razor blade to cut off her son’s male sexual organ. Delivering the judgment, Resident Magistrate Ramadhan Rugemalira said the accused committed the offence against Section 222(b) of Penal Code (Cap 16, R.E 2019). He further said the prosecution, led by Assistant Inspector Rajab Mrisho, had proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the offence was committed by Mwaniwasa. The prosecution summoned four witnesses to testify in court. The magistrate warned the convict to refrain from committing any criminal offences while serving her suspended sentence. Earlier, it was established in the court that Mwaniwasa committed the offence on December 26, last year, at Katuka Village at about 8.00pm. It was further alleged before the court that the wounded baby was then rushed to Matai Health Centre before taken to Rukwa Regional Referral Hospital in Sumbawanga Town. Mwaniwasa prayed to the court to forgive her saying it was her first time to commit such an offence and she was taking care of four other children.
