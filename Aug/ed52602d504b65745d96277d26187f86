As the world marks world breastfeeding week, the World Health Organization now implores mothers to continue breastfeeding even if contracted with COVID-19. While addressing a news conference World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus noted that the benefits of breastfeeding outweigh the risk of infection. “WHO recommends that mothers with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should be encouraged the same as all other mothers to initiate or continue breastfeeding,” The theme of World Breastfeeding Week 2020 is “Support breastfeeding for a healthier planet”. In line with this theme, WHO and UNICEF are calling on governments to protect and promote women’s access to skilled breastfeeding counselling, a critical component of breastfeeding support.
