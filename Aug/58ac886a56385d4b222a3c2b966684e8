A THREE-Y EAR strategic plan by Tanzania Coffee Research Institute (TaCRI) to produce and distribute 23 million improved Arabica seedlings to farmers is making significant progress. This was said by the Ta-CRI’s Programme Manager, Dr Magesa Jeremiah at this year’s Nane Nane farmer’s exhibitions taking place at Nyakabindi ground in Simiyu region, recently, while it was being officially opened by the Vice-President Mama Samia Suluhu Hassan. He said Tanzania Coffee B oard (TCB ) is also taking place in the scheme that would double coffee production in Mara region as well as others. “We have continued to execute our strategy to produce and distribute 23 million best seedlings in collaboration with TCB ,” Dr Jeremiah said. The production of the seedlings goes hand in hand with educating farmers on best coffee farming methods, and Extensions Officers, who are training and supervising the work. Explaining further, he said they have managed to produce nearly 10 million improved Arabica seedlings by June this year, and the work would continue. On his part, TaCRI Sirari Station Officer-in-Charge, Mr Almas Hamadi, noted that the institute plans to produce one million seedlings during 2020/2021 season for Tarime District alone. That was after a realisation that Tarime is the leading producer of Arabica coffee in Mara region.
