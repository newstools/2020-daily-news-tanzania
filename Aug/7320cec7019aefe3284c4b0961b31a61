TANZANIANS have been urged to show up in big numbers to access the Registration Insolvency and Trusteeship Agency (RITA) services, which are their rights. Speaking at the Nyakibindi grounds in Bariadi district Simiyu Region at the Nanenane Exhibition, the Agency’s Spokesperson, Grace Kyasi said their services facilitate access to social services including education, health, higher education loans and as well as registration of marriages. “It’s crucial for members of the public to be familiar with our services, which are crucial for the wellbeing and development of an individual in the country. “For one to have access to some loans, employment, education and adoption, one must have birth certificate that is issued by Rita, more so, the agency deals with registration of will and divorce, all these are crucial services Tanzanians should be aware of,” she said. Equally, Ms Kyasi was of the view that their services are for everyone since all Tanzanians require birth certificates and even after passing away, it would be crucial for the family members to be issued with a death certificate for a member who dies. To improve service delivery, the agency has embarked on online services to enable Tanzanians to apply for the Rita services online which are quick and fast. In November last year, the government said plans were underway to electronically register and issue birth certificates to over 15 million Tanzanians by the year 2025. So far, RITA has registered and issued birth certificates to more than 3.7million that includes children aged five and over 450,000 Primary and Secondary School children aged between five and 17. The children under five were issued with the documents through the initiative developed by RITA to increase the proportion of under-five children with birth certificates in the registration exercise in Tanzania mainland.
