THE clash between the defending champions KMKM and Malindi is expected to herald the resumption of Isles Premier League tomorrow after a few weeks break. Three venues will host the league resumption that will see four matches being played. The league was briefly halted to give teams an opportunity to sign new players in the just ended minitransfer window and also to enable them play in the Mapinduzi Cup tournament, whose champions are Mtibwa Sugar of Morogoro. Defending champions KMKM will be at Amaan Stadium here to face Malindi, according to the fixture released by the organisers Zanzibar Football Federation (ZFF). The match is likely to be tough and highly competitive as the both sides boast a number of high skilled players. Still KMKM are leading the league table with 26 points. KMKM opponents Malindi are standing at the 9th position with 12 points after playing nine matches. Also to be played tomorrow are Chuoni FC who face Salem View at Mao Tse Dong stadium while at Gombani stadium in Pemba two matches will be staged there. The first match, according to the fixture, will be between Mwenge and Jangâ€™ombe Boys while the second one will see Chipukizi hosting Polisi Zanzibar. Behind the leaders KMKM are second-placed Zimamoto who have fetched 25 while at the bottom there are Chipukizi with 2 points while just above them are Kipanga who have collected seven points.
