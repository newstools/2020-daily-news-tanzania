SINGIDA Regional Commissioner, Dr Rehema Nchimbi has urged producers of various products in the region to maintain quality and agreed standards so as to protect consumers and boost their businesses. She was speaking to products producers and entrepreneurs during the opening of an awareness training that was organised by the Tanzania Bureau of Standards (TBS) in the region. She said quality and standard products give assurance to reliable market and profit. The training brought together food, sunflower cooking oil processors and cosmetics dealers in the area. The RC said standard was a key factor in promoting businesses in and outside the country and that whoever is engaged in any form of production must maintain both quality and standards. “ The Tanzania Bureau of Standards (TBS) is here for you. We must use this opportunity for learning and gaining new skills,” she said. According to DR Nchimbi, substandard food items affect people’s health, therefore the government through TBS and other bodies is keen to ensure whatever is produced has all required qualities for consumption. “ TBS is not an enemy of producers, it is the body that helps all of us to understand important issues including regulations that govern production in our industries and processing factories,” she said. For his part the TBS Training and Research Manager, Hamis Sudi, said the bureau will continue to provide education to the public regarding standards and quality of products including locally produced and those, which are imported from abroad. He said TBS recognizes and value the contribution of local producers and that so far it has reached 221 entrepreneurs in Iramba, Manyoni and Singida.
