TANZANIA Agricultural Research Institute (TARI) in Kibaha Town District, Coast Region, has started conducting research on new varieties of sugarcane which are draught resistant to increase production. Kibaha TARI Manager, Dr Hildelitha Msita, said during a recent interview in her office that though the centre had been entrusted with the coordination and supervision of all researches on sugarcane for some years no research on draught resistant varieties was conducted. “Our centre is now concentrating on research and will come up with varieties which are disease and drought resistance. The aim is to increase production especially at this time of industrial growth,” she said. Dr Msita explained the centre had been able to produce varieties suitable for irrigation, including N-19, N-25, N-30, N-41, R-570, R-575 and R-579 which had been researched on between 2010 and 2014. “We started conducting research on draught resistant varieties from 2013 and 2014 and through this research we have been able to discover two suitable varieties,” she said. However, Dr Msita pointed out that they had not provided statistics yet of the approved varieties. On the other hand Dr Msita used the opportunity to advise individuals who planned to invest in sugar industries to use the centre to get information and know the technology on starting sugarcane farms, saying doing so would benefit them and the nation as well.
