ALL Zanzibaris are entitled to the National Identification Authority (NIDA) issued identity cards and there is no requirement to access the document, the House of Representatives heard on Friday. Deputy Minister of State in the Presidentâ€™s Office, Regional Administration, Local Government and Special Departments Shamata Shaame Khamis said the IDs were being issued as per law that provides for registration in Tanzania Mainland and Zanzibar. He was answering a question by Konde Legislator Omar Seif Abeid who sought explanations over the alleged differences in the requirements for the national ID between the islanders and mainlanders. Mr Shaame said the law has set similar requirements for Tanzanians on both parts of the union, with the only difference being the channels through which the application forms are processed. While in Zanzibar applicants have to channel their applications through shehias, while on the mainland, applicants channel theirs through the village chairpersons and village executive officers. However, he said, the ID number is issued once the registration officer is convinced that all the processes, including filling the forms, photo taking and scanning all the information, are completed.
