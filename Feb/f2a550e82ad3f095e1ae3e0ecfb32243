TRAIN services on the central line have been seized temporarily due to damages resulted from ongoing rain in the country, Tanzania Railway Corporation (TRC) announced early on Wednesday. Floods have affected different parts of the country including Kilosa, Igandu, Dodoma and Makutupora where the central line passes. “Almost 26 areas are affected, 10 among which are worst with some infrastructures washed out by floods,” the statement said. The statement expressed that TRC is currently working to rectify the situation to ensure the services resume immediately. The backbone of the Central Corridor is the Central Rail Line that runs between Dar es Salaam and Kigoma in western Tanzania and to Mwanza in the Northern Tanzania.
