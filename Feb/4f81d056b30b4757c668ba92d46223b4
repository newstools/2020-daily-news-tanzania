POLICE in Kisarawe District, Coast Region through its Gender Desk has launched a campaign known as ‘End Gender Violence in Kisarawe’ that will eliminate violence acts against girl child in the area. Speaking during the inauguration recently, Kisarawe Officer Commanding District (OCD), SSP Eva Stesheni said that the campaign is being coordinated by the Police force in collaboration with the school in the district.“Violence acts like rape and others have continued to be reported in our district. Last year, we received a total of 55 cases, which were all related to rape,” she said. SSP Stesheni further said that: “In a period between January 10th to February 22nd this year, 20 cases of rape have been reported, and this shocked us to think of a solution that has midwifed this launch for a special campaign to educate the communities.” She further said that the aim of the campaign was to raise awareness and motivate the public to fight all sorts of violence against women. “The desk will help students and individuals on what to do after being sexually abused so that they do not interfere with evidence. Another aim of this campaign would be to enlighten them on their rights as survivors of gender violence acts,” added the cop. However, she appealed to the public to cooperative and work with the police to eliminate gender violence in the area by providing clues, which lead to the arrest of the culprits.
