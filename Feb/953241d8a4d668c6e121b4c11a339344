WOMEN entrepreneurs have been advised to pull up their resources and mobilize themselves into manageable business groups, which would enable them to enjoy advantages of collective production and access to banking products tailored for groups. The call was made in Dar es Salaam by NBC Manager of Retail Liability products, Ms. Dorothea Mabonye, while addressing a conference organized for women entrepreneurs by regional barcode commodities traceability systems service providers ‘GS1 Tanzania and bankrolled by the financial bank. Expounding, she noted that her financial institution sponsored the conference on a two-tier goal, first to empower women in business by ensuring that they are mobilized in their respective groups and on the hand to equip them with necessary business skills before offering them relevant bank product(s), which would catalyze their sustainable business growth. “NBC banks on its experienced bankers, who understand that mobilization of business schemes and ventures is crucial for micro enterprises, if at all their entrepreneurship efforts are to thrive and unleash its intended potentials,” said Ms Mabonye. The banker’s views were seconded by a participant, Rosemary Mugarula, saying: “The training has enlightened us on the need to unite if we are to run projects sustainably, we have now realised it is easier to move forward as a group. “I call upon women to mobilize themselves in productive units and tap into many opportunities that exist in the unity.” Speaking at the event that was attended by over 500 women, NBC Brand and Communications Manager, David Raymond, said the bank has a wide range of affordable and easy-to-use products, which include those tailored to serve productive groups to those that are suitable for women in general.
