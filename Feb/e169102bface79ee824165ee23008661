PRIME Minister Kassim Majaliwa has directed councils in the country to assess the damage caused by ongoing rain on infrastructure, including roads and bridges, and send a report to his office for further action. He gave the directive on Thursday while addressing members of CCM Executive Committee in Bukoba Municipal Council. He promised that the government had set aside a budget for refurbishing damaged infrastructure to facilitate the transportation of goods and people, assuring Tanzanians of the availability of money for the work. Mr Majaliwa also directed the Immigration Department to scrutinise people seeking identification cards so that no non-Tanzanians was issued with IDs. He promised to allocate more officers to the National Identification Agency (NIDA), who would add impetus for issuing NIDA numbers. This follows concern raised by several MPs who informed him that many people had not been issued with IDs. Kyerwa MP Innocent Bilakwate noted that out of 128,000 people who were registered those issued NIDA numbers were 14,000 (about 10.9 per cent). “NIDA should pull up its socks and speed up the exercise. People are in confusion because most of them their mobile phones have been switched off,” he lamented. Mr Majaliwa who is in Kagera Region on a two-day visit also reminded traders interested in buying coffee to follow legal procedures.
