The Majimaji War (1904– 1907) was the most significant uprising mounted by Tanzanians against the German colonial rule. It was also one of the most catastrophic events in the colonial history of Africa. Between 100,000 and 300,000 people of southern Tanzania died from the war and its aftermath including hunger. Colonialism was one of the major causes of uprising. Majimaji uprising was also caused by forced labour. The Africans were forced to work on German construction projects like buildings, road, and railway networks as well as crop plantation including cotton production.
