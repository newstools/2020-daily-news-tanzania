NATIONAL women football team, Twiga Stars Head Coach, Bakari Shime expects to maintain perfect start at the Union of North African Football Federations (UNAF) as they face Algeria today. Twiga Stars went rampant to sweep Mauritanian 7-0 in their opening match of the campaign at the Al-Karam Stadium in Rades, Tunisia on Friday. Twiga Stars scored all goals in the first 45 opening minutes through Amina Ally, Oppa Clement and Enekia Kasonga, who scored one each, while Asha Hamza and Mwanahamisi Omary scored a brace each. In the second stanza, Twiga Stars merely turned the game to a practice session and did not score more goals and this did not impress coach Shime, who insisted that they will need to keep improving and score as many goals as they can. “The game was great and I congratulate my players for playing well considering it was our first game against Mauritania. We played well and we ought to have scored more goals in the second half but we wasted hosts of scoring opportunities, we must improve from here.” “The technical bench will look at how to fix the mistakes we saw in our first game to avoid them from repeating today and throughout the tournament,” he said. After the Friday’s results, Twiga Stars commands the five teams’ national league with three points and seven goals. Second placed is Morocco, who won 1-0 against the host Tunisia. Tunisia and Mauritanian follows behind with no points, same as Algeria who will play their first game today. The five-nation tournament features Tunisia, Morocco and Algeria, with Mauritania and two-time CECAFA champions Tanzania participating as guest nations in the absence of Egypt and Libya.
