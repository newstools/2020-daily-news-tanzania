TANZANIA National Parks Authority (Tanapa) Board of Trustees has visited districts of Mara Region near Serengeti National Park and called upon investors to utilise investment opportunities available in the sector of tourism. The delegation was led by Tanapa board of trustees chairman Gen (retired) George Waitara. The former chief of Defence Forces said Tarime was one of the districts in Mara Region endowed with diverse tourism opportunities that had not been utilised to boost economic development in the area. Besides bordering the northern fringes of Senapa, the district is home to Tanzania-Kenya Sirari border which is the gateway for tourists visiting the country through the neibhouring country. "Tarime has a number of tourism opportunities and I call upon citizens of this area to utilise them," Gen Waitara said. He called upon both local and foreign investors to utilise investment opportunities available in the area, especially on operating companies and tourist hotels. "It takes only two hours for one to reach Serengeti and the climate of Tarime is also good," he added. He noted that availability of classic hotels would attract many tourists in the district. “Wildlife,” he said, “has a significant contribution to the development of  local communities living near national parks and the nation as a whole through substantial incomes coming from the tourism sector.” Thus, he emphasised the importance of protecting the country's national parks and other protected areas. Tarime District Commissioner Mtemi Msafiri commended the Tanapa board of trustees for touring the district. The Tanapa board of trustees visited Magena Airstrip mostly used by tourists and the Sirari border among other places.
