THE government announced yesterday that it has allocated more than 25bn/- to repair roads, which are currently affected by rains in several parts of the country. Deputy Minister for Works Elias Kwandikwa said the rains that began late last year left several towns disconnected, though the government has taken measures including allocation of fund to repair them. Mr Kwandikwa who was travelling from Dodoma, Tabora, Shinyanga and Mwanza to establish the magnitude of the floods on the key infrastructure, directed the national roads agency- Tanroads to maintain quality standards of roads across the country. “We will be spending at least 25bn/- to repair such roads washed out by floods,” he added. He planned to inspect the 148 km stretch on Kahama- Mwananga Highway that was hit hard by floods in Lake Victoria Zone. The road is potential, because it connects residents in Mwanza with Kahama, though its 2.3km section was critically affected and forced passengers to look for alternative routes. “The rains have pushed the government to reconsider the area and currently, it has embarked on conducting a feasibility study. We have learnt the hard way and we are soliciting funds to upgrade it to tarmac standards,” he said in a press statement issued by the ministry’s communication unit in Dodoma. Currently, transporters will now have to use Kahama—Isaka— Tinde to reach Mwanza. He said the government is monitoring all such stubborn places across the country with a view to fixing them. On his part, Tanzania National Roads Agency (Tanroads) Acting Regional Head of Maintenance Unit, Eng Frednand Mdoe admitted that the agency had struggled to restore service in areas that were hit by heavy rains.
