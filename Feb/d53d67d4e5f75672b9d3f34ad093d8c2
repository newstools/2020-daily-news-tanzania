TANZANIA’s construction industry is projected to grow and register outstanding performance due to rising demand for pre-engineered building solutions that reduce construction time and cost. ALAF Tanzania, Civil Engineer, Erick Sumary said in Dar es Salaam over the weekend that the pre-engineered steel building, ‘SAFBUILD’ solutions have revolutionized the construction industry by meeting the demand for innovative, cost-effective, and fast-paced construction of modern infrastructure. “With a projected growth in the pre-engineered buildings market, we have introduced Safbuild to cater for consumers seeking cost-effective and environmental friendly solutions,” he said noting we are exploring significant investments in Safbuild as an upgrade to the local steel Pebs rather than their replacement. He said Safbuild is targeting investors keen in single pre-engineered building spaces such as factories, warehouses, storage facilities, and industrial plants. To reduce operations costs, Safbuild is designed and detailed on a design and analysis software that speedily automates a customer’s journey from idea to full project detailing within minutes, anchored on a stringent, worldclass design code that factors superior parameters to applicable local standards. A report by TechSci Research valued the global pre-engineered building market at around 13 billion US dollars and forecasted it to grow at a compound annual growth rate of over 11 per cent to reach around 25 billion US dollars by 2024. He said Safbuild integrates other ALAF’s building solutions including various roofing and wall cladding profiles and flashing elements, underlay Saftherm heat barrier-membranes, raingain rain-water harvesting accessories and matching performance fixtite fasteners. ALAF shall liaise with the project consultants to avail all technical details required at both the design and implementation phases of the project and further offer erection supervision at site to ensure quality and design standards are met, he said. Mr Sumary added that the all this departs from the market norm of conventional heavy, hot-rolled steel construction that is slower, laborious and often prone to site rework.
