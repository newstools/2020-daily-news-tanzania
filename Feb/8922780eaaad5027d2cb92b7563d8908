KOBE Bryant and his 13-year-old daughter Gianna were buried in a private funeral service at Orange County, California last Friday, Unites States press has revealed. Kobe and Gianna "Gigi" Bryant were among nine passengers who died in a helicopter crash in Calabasas, California, end of January. Their remains were returned to the Bryant family last Tuesday. According to a source, "Vanessa and the family wanted a private service to mourn their loss." "The ceremony was extremely hard for everyone as it's still hard for them to grasp they lost two beautiful souls." A public memorial service is planned for February 24 at Staples Center, a date with significance for both Kobe and Gigi. February, being the second month, represents Gianna's No. 2 jersey at the Mamba Sports Academy. The day, 24, matches one of Kobe Bryant's two jersey numbers for the Lakers. The memorial will also honor the seven other victims of the helicopter crash: Alyssa Altobelli, John Altobelli, Keri Altobelli, Payton Chester, Sarah Chester, Christina Mauser and Ara Zobayan, who was the helicopter pilot.
