TANZANIA’S income per capita is projected to rise to 1,707 US dollars ( about 4m/-) next year, up from this year’s projection of 1550 USD, said the Tanzania Investment Centre (TIC). Giving a presentation before the Parliamentary Committee here, TIC Director General Geoffrey Mwambe said the country’s economy has been on steady growth in the last ten years, as the agency gave evidence for the contention in that document presented before parliamentarians. The document says that in 2017, the GDP grew by 7 per cent while the per capita income stood at 178 USD. In 2018 GDP grew by 7.1 per cent and the per capita income rose to 1293 USD. “We see the per capita income rising again this year to 1550 USD, and our projections show that there will be yet another good rise to 1707 USD next year,” Mr Mwambe told the MPs. According to the document, in 2010 the GDP grew by 7pc and per capita income stood at 530. Per capita income has steadily increased since then, reaching 971 USD in 2015 and jumping to 1071 in 2016 and making another big leap to 1178 USD in 2017. “Tanzania is now one of Africa’s most exciting investment destinations.” Quoting the ranking made by the Rand Merchant Bank in 2018, the document says Tanzania is positioned to the seventh slot, Egypt in the first slot followed by South Africa. In the top ten group of Africa’s attractive investment destinations formulated by the bank, Kenya was put in the fifth slot. Between 1990 and December 2018, the document lists top ten foreign countries that have invested in Tanzania as China, UK, USE, Mauritius, lndia, Australia, Kenya, The Netherlands, Belgium and Egypt, collectively investing in 3,173 projects valued at 29,120.36 million USD, creating 549,770 jobs. According to the document, of projects started during that period, 43 per cent belong to Tanzanians, 28 per cent to foreigners and 29 per cent are partnerships. During the same period, a total of 11,509 projects registered in 15 sectors: 9,248 were new ones, 3,500 (expanded), 6,047 (Tanzanianowned), 3,978 (partnerships) and the projects created collectively 1,517,306 jobs. Challenges that are highlighted in the document include ever-changing global incentives to attract investors. Locally: problematic and deficiencies in the 2014 Value-Added Tax Act, the 1996 National Investment Policy, the 1997 Investment Act and insufficient skilled workforce. The centre suggests that the Investment Act should be the Framework Law in using and interpreting laws relating to investment. It also calls for a handsome budget to administer successfully the land bank fund.
