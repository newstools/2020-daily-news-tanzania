SURETIES for former Singida East Member of Parliament (MP) Tundu Lissu have applied for his arrest for allegedly refusing to come back from Belgium to attend his sedition trial. Ibrahim Ahmed and Robert Katula told Principal Resident Magistrate Thomas Simba at the Kisutu Resident Magistrate's Court in Dar es Salaam on Thursday that they have filed an application for the court to issue a warrant of arrest so that the politician could be brought to the country to face the criminal trial. Hearing of the case, which also involves are two seasoned Journalists Simon Mkina and Jabir Yunus, as well as businessman and Printer Ismail Mehbood, has failed to proceed for more than two years now because of Lissu's absence and the two sureties have failed to convince him to come back from abroad. The prosecution, led by Senior State Attorney Wankyo Simon acknowledged to have been served with the application in question, but reserved their comments on the matter until tomorrow (Friday) when there would be another court session, as directed by the court. Full story will be published tomorrow (Friday, February 21, 2020) on the Daily News
