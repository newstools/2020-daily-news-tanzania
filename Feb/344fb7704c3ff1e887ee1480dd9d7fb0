Local investors were dominant of the market during the week, corresponding with the dominance of CRDB on the turnover. Local investors accounted for 98.66 per cent of both, investment and divestment, while foreign investors accounted for the balance. Money Market, Bills and Bonds The interbank rate on the Interbank Money Market (IMM) gained 26bps complemented by a 39.5 per cent slowdown in trading activities. The weekly total traded on the IMM was TZS 109.5bln ($47.59mln) while the interbank rate rose to 4.13 per cent. There has been variations in activities on the IMM as the banking sector catches momentum. Credit growth to the private sector grew to 11.1 per cent during December 2020, highest in the last three years, while liquidity in the banking sector maintains stability. Investors’ appetite on the 20 years Treasury bond is seen increasing as the auction held on 12th February 2020 was oversubscribed by 285 per cent. The Bank of Tanzania offered the 20 years Treasury bond worth 117bn/- ($50.85mln) while the public raised a total tender size of 450.88bn/- ($195.95mln) from 566 bids up from 443 bids during the previous auction. The Bank of Tanzania accepted 208 bids worth 113.55bn/- ($49.35mln) which was 3 per cent lower than the offer size. The minimum successful price jumped 300bps to 95.1534 while the highest bid price jumped 484bps to 98.8450. The spread between the lowest and highest successful bid prices has been tightening over the auctions from 1,794bps during the first 20 years T-bond in September 2018 to 1,042bps during the auction under review, signaling an increasing demand from investors. The weighted average yield to maturity (WAYTM) fell by 46.3bps to 16.76 per cent as the Bank pushes to limit the cost of debt for the government while suppressing interest rates in the process. Considering the amount of demand, we expect a further decline of WAYTM and possibly bids at par. Currency Market The shilling has depreciated by 6 pips week on week on the Interbank Foreign Exchange Market (IFEM), reaching the lowest point since June 2019. The depreciation is seasonal as it marks a third consecutive week. Foreign inflows are minimal during the first quarter due to seasonal slowdown of traditional exports and tourism. High inflows are expected when summer begins, influencing tourism in the West. The shilling closed the week at a weighted average exchange rate of TZS 2,300.96/USD, down 99 pips since the beginning of the year. The total weekly turnover on the IFEM grew by 51 per cent to $11.18mln compared to $7.4mln. The Monthly Economic Review for December 2019 by the Bank of Tanzania suggests there to have been an excess of foreign currency in the banking sector after the Bank mopped up 117 million or rather injected 269bn/- along with a net injection of 49bn/- ($21.34mln) through reverse repo sales. Foreign reserves maintained at 5.5 billion US dollars similar to November, while Balance of Payment surplus went down 20.24 per cent from 702.5 million US dollars to 560.3 million US dollars. Although still stable at 3.7 per cent during January 2020, demand-pull inflation, potentially from desert locust crisis and the corona virus, poses a slight risk on the shilling’s stability.
