CITY Council of Dodoma (CCD) Director, Godwin Kunambi is calling on ward leaders across the city to mobilize residents in their respective areas to participate in weekend cleanliness exercise geared towards making the Capital City clean. At a recent cleanliness stakeholders meeting hosted by the City Council here, Mr Kunambi noted that ward councilors, chairpersons and executive officers should use the authority bestowed upon them to mobilize people in participating in cleanliness exercise. “I am calling on ward leaders to use the mandate bestowed on them to mobilize people to take part in cleanliness because you are the ones who are close to the people,” said the City Council Director. Mr Kunambi said the City Council had entered into an agreement with Green Waste Pro Company Limited, saying the Dar es Salaam-based waste management company has modern technology equipment to manage waste. Speaking at the same meeting, Head of Sanitation and Waste Management Department in the City Council, Mr Dickson Kimaro, said the waste management company had introduced tagging system, a new system to manage waste. “We should join hands with them (Green Waste Pro Company) to enable them carry out their duties efficiently,” he said. Mr Kimaro explained the advent of tagging system will help to address challenges in garbage collection in Dodoma City, and that the system will improve efficiency in revenue collection from clients. On his part, Executive Director of Green Waste Pro Limited, Mr Deogratius Lutazar, said the main goal of introducing tagging system was to simplify garbage collection from city residents, saying the new system will help to control waste of revenue. “The new system will identify a number of residents across the streets. The system will control revenue waste paid by residents in waste collection,” he said. He urged city dwellers to cooperate with them in applying the system which will help to identify residents at all levels, from ward to street.
