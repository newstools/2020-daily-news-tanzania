THE Revolutionary Government of Zanzibar remains tough against labour laws' abusers, some of whom it has already taken to court. Labour, Empowerment, Elderly, Youth, Women and Children Minister Maudline Cyrus Castico told the House of Representatives here yesterday that labour disputes were inevitable, blaming desperate job seekers, who accept employments under unfavourable terms. But, she said the government through the ministry has always remained tough against wayward employers especially in the tourism industry. That was when she was fielding questions from members of the house over rampant abuses of workers by private employers in the isles' tourism sector. Earlier, Labour Deputy Minister Shadya Mohamed Suleiman said there had been mounting complaints by employees in the private sector, particularly the tourist hotels, over grave mistreatments like indiscriminate dismissal and poor payments. She accused the labour inspectors of failure to perform their duties effectively, sometimes colluding with employers against the employees. "Our inspectors who visit the hotels hardly perform their duties, they seem to accept food and money offers and forget to address the problems of employees," Ms Mohamed told the house in response to Paje Lawmaker Jaku Hashim Ayoub, who wanted to know the government actions against abusive employers. The deputy minister invited all people with evidence of abused employee to her office for appropriate actions, saying beside the labour office, other government institutions --Tanzania Revenue Authority, Immigration Department, Zanzibar Social Security Fund, Zanzibar Revenue Board and trade unions were also working on the matter
