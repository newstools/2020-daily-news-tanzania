WORKS, Transport and Communication Minister Engineer Isack Kamwelwe has issued the Land Transport Regulatory Authority (LATRA) a seven-day ultimatum to ensure that dilapidated Moshi-Arusha railway line is up and running. The minister further tasked the regulatory authority to conduct a thorough inspection of the rail tracks for flaws that could result in catastrophic failures if not rectified on time. Eng Kamwelwe who was speaking here after inspecting the 86-kilometer line aboard an Inspection Car, challenged LATRA to ensure timely rehabilitation of the 37-year old line to allow the Tanzania Railway Corporation (TRC) cargo train start plying the route smoothly. “We’ve waited for so long for this to happen, we wouldn’t want to wait any longer in the spirit of reviving this reliable mode of transport,” explained the minister. Once the railway line comes to fruition, it will signal the beginning of the Moshi-Arusha passenger train, anytime this year, said Eng Kamwelwe. “The rehabilitation is at 86 per cent, which is a good step but the authority has to ensure the remaining stretch is completed on time”. The Moshi-Arusha railway line has a total of 37 bridges. It was last used in 1986. Earlier on, TRC Managing Director Dr Masanja Kadogosa informed the minister that the state-owned enterprise was determined to revive all defunct railway lines with a view of stimulating the country's economic growth. “Our zeal is always to see Tanzanians enjoying and making the most of trains,” he said. The maiden cargo trip will be a litmus test for the 37-year old tracks as it prepares to handle the much awaited passenger train, according to the TRC boss. In Tanzania, the railway network covers almost all key economic zones. According to economists, railway transport remains a crucial mode of transport for economic growth of any country. This is attested by the fact that more cargo can be hauled at one time and the fact that it is safer compared to using roads.
