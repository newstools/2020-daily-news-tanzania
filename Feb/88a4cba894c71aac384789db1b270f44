THE Tanzania Share Index (TSI) maintained the rally during the week that ended on the 07th February 2020. The TSI gained 9.95 points following a 0.29 per cent uptick on the domestic market capitalization. The TSI closed the week with 3,474.38 points while the domestic market capitalization closed the week at 9.12tri/- ($3.97bln). The domestic rally was a result of a 7.7 per cent gain on CRDB Bank (DSE: CRDB) counter which moved from 130/- to 140/- per share. The price of CRDB has been growing since the beginning of the year reflecting the bankâ€™s outstanding performance and fundamentals for the FY2019. The bank accounted for 2.63 per cent of the total equity turnover realized during the week. The total turnover for the week grew by more than three folds to a total of 9.89bn/- ($4.3mln) compared to 2.86bn/- ($1.11mln) realized during the previous week. Number of shares traded grew by 87 per cent to a total of 3.06 million shares compared to 1.64mln shares during the previous week. The increased turnover and number of shares traded is mostly rooted on the TBL counter. Tanzania Breweries Ltd (DSE: TBL) remained the top mover of the week similar to the previous week. TBL accounted for 96.7 per cent of the total equity turnover realized during the week. The turnover for TBL totaled to TZS 9.56bln ($4.16mln) mostly realized on off-market block transactions at a price of 8,000/- per share, despite maintaining a closing price of 10,900/-. Since the new trading rules became effective during August 2019, most of the equity turnover has been realized in off market block transactions. During January 2020, more than 98 per cent of market transactions went through offmarket transactions. More than 99.9 per cent of TBL shares went through off-market transactions during January 2020. A transaction needs a value above 200m/- ($86,922) to qualify for an off-market block transaction. Since August 2019 TBL has been going through at prices below 9,000/-, more than 17.4 per cent discount from the official closing price. The consequence is a lockout of retail investors who cannot afford blocks of above 200m/- ($86,922). The rally spreads to the total market capitalisation which grew by 0.83 per cent following a rally on cross listed counters. The All Share Index (DSEI) climbed 17.62 points to close the week at 2,130.39 points while the total market capitalization closed the week at 17.68tri/- ($7.69bln). On top of CRDB, the rally of the total market results from price appreciation on two giants, East African Breweries Ltd (DSE: EABL) and KCB Bank (DSE: KCB) by 2.04 per cent and 1.69 per cent, respectively. The appreciation on the two giants was enough to offset the 2.44 per cent on both Jubilee Holdings Ltd (DSE: JHL) and National Media Group (DSE: NMG) respectively. Foreign investors were marginally weekly net buyers after accounting for 96.63 per cent of the total investments and 96.62 per cent of the total divestments. Net inflow from foreign investment totaled to TZS 590,000 ($257). Money Market, Bills and Bonds Activities in the Interbank Money Market (IMM) shot up more than three folds to a total transaction value of 181bn/-($78.66mln) compared to 51bn/- ($22.17mln) traded during the previous week. The increased supply of funds on the IMM relaxed the interbank rate by 28bps to a weighted average interbank rate of 3.87 per cent. Among the four Treasury bills tenors, only the 364days was oversubscribed during the auction held on the 05th February 2020. The Bank of Tanzania offered Treasury bills worth 107.2bn/- ($46.59mln). The auction received a total of 80 bids of which 76 bids fetched the 364days tenor. The total tender size was 146.19bn/- ($63.53mln), 99.26 per cent of which fetched the 364days tenor. The Bank of Tanzania accepted a total of 28 bids of which 26 bids were for the 364days tenor. The total accepted amount was 82.78bn/- ($35.98mln) which was 22.8 per cent less than the offer size. Despite a reduced successful amount, the total weighted average yield to maturity (WAYTM) gained 1bps to 5.81 per cent. The WAYTM gained despite a fall in yield on all maturity tenors. Currency Market The value of transactions on the Interbank Foreign Exchange Market (IFEM) fell by 16 per cent to a weekly total of $7.4mln. The deceleration marks a second week in a row, maintaining the trend that began in January 2020 as the demand for foreign currency slackened. However, signaling a slight shortage, the reduced traded volumes fell with the shilling. The shilling slightly depreciated during the week by losing 7 pips. The shilling has depreciated by 93 pips since the beginning of the year. The shilling closed the week at TZS 2,300.90/USD.
