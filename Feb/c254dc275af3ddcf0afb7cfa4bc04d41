ISLES were forced to dig deeper to salvage a point when they forced a 1-1 draw with Malindi in a thrilling game at Amaan Stadium here on Monday. Only luck saved KMKM from conceding their first loss of the season as their equalizer came almost at the stoppage time. KMKM capitalised on goalkeeping blunder committed by Malindi FC custodian Ahmed Ali Salula who fumbled the ball and KMKM striker, Ventiraus Kamanya rushed in timely to fire it home. Malindi, who looked a superior side in the whole first half were the first to open a goal account in the 43rd minute through Amour Omar Janja who completed Twaha Nassor’s clean assist. The goal silenced KMKM, who were on a poor form that day, and the goal remained unanswered until the end of the first half. On resumption, Malindi continued to outplay the defending champions by creating more scoring chances. If their strikers had effectively utilised the chances, they could have won the game by a big margin. Most of the missed opportunities were squandered by their central striker, Amour Omar Janja, who wasted countless chances. KMKM who fielded their veteran players such as Maulid Ibrahim Kapenta and Saidi Bura failed to create scoring chances at their opponents’ goal because its defence line under Abuubakar Ame ‘Luiz’ stood firm. Despite the draw, KMKM continue to command the league run with 27 points followed by Zimamoto who have garnered 25 points
