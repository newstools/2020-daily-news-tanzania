The forum to be staged from March 9th to 14th will be held in Dar es Salaam, where a pool of professionals will mingle with entrepreneurs for a week. TAA Chairperson, Peter Mwambuja, told journalists on Monday that this year’s theme would be ‘Accountants Join Factories for Economic Growth and Community Development.’ “During the forum accountants and auditors will meet different staff from various institutions to discuss financial matters,” Mr Mwambuja said. The chairperson said such arrangement would be the first of its kind in Dar es Salaam, where a pool of the professionals would listen and advice traders, individuals and company representatives on how to address their business challenges professionally. “I would appeal to entrepreneurs, salaried workers, farmers, livestock keepers, fishermen and different institutions to meet pool of professionals to advise them professionally in business,” said the Chairman. He listed some of the services they would offer during the event as advisory services, mentorship to enable accountants and auditors grow in their institutions and for those willing to start their own projects or business enterprises. Also, the activities will include community services like cleaning public hospitals, markets, adding that it would be a great event that the public should exploit, because all their services would be free of charge. Furthermore, Mr Mwambuja said that the occasion should also be interpreted as their plough back to the community that is creating a favourable environment for traders to engage in a climate of business.
