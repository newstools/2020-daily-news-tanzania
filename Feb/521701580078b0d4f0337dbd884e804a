KAGERA Region is on high alert against outbreaks of Yellow Fever and CoronaVirus diseases should cases be confirmed, it has been disclosed. Kagera Regional Health Officer, Mr Nelson Rumberi informed the Regional Consultative Committee (RCC) meeting in Bukoba Municipal Council yesterday that all necessary preparedness are in place especially at points of entries. “All preparedness measures have been taken at all points of entries including Mutukula, Murongo, Kabanga and Rusumo. A team of medical experts have been dispatched to the areas to monitor the exercise. We have also received various equipment, including about 142 masks as precaution against Coronavirus and people being educated on how to avoid the diseases,” he said. On Yellow Fever, he said efforts have been taken to control malaria by increasing the use of Insectcide Treated Nets (ITN) and wearing long sleeved garments in the evening. However, he noted that three cases of Yellow Fever had been reported in neighbouring Uganda, but emphasized that so far no case had been reported in the region. Kagera Region shares borders with three neighbouring countries-Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi. Meanwhile, Legislator for Bukoba Rural, Mr Jasson Rweikiza has appealed for government intervention to upgrade Maruku Dispensary to a Health Centre status. He explained that the residents mobilized themselves by constructing its main buildings, which include a Maternal and Pediatric Ward, a theatre and a mortuary, saying: “Upgrading the Dispensary to a Health Centre in Maruku and Kanyangero Wards would ensure the people with better health care services.” Data shows that lack of affordable, and quality health care continue to trap many into poverty circles. Globally, as many as 100 million people a year are pushed into poverty due to high health care costs, and about 30 per cent of households in Africa and Asia have to borrow money or sell assets to pay for health.
