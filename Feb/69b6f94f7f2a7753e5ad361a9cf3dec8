THE Tanzania Bureau of Standards (TBS) has said producing goods that meet the quality standards is of paramount for entrepreneurs with an endeavor to win wider regional and global markets. However, TBS cautions that producing high quality goods without having the TBS quality standard mark reduces chances for grabbing such markets. This was unveiled during the consultation meetings between the government, investors and business people taking place in various parts of the country. The consultation meetings in the Lake Zones regions of Mara, Mwanza, Simiyu and Shinyanga were attended by ministers and deputy ministers from four ministries. The TBS Director General, Dr Yusuf Ngenya told entrepreneurs here yesterday on various opportunities including the quality standard mark provided by the bureau which is necessary for easy accessibility of the local and global markets. "Supporting entrepreneursâ€™ efforts to make their goods penetrate more markets is one of reasons behind TBS campaigns countrywide imparting knowledge and skills on quality standards," he said. Furthermore, Dr Ngenya said entrepreneurs may acquire quality standard mark for free and use for three years. The government introduced this initiative to support entrepreneurs particularly small scale to expand their businesses by accessing more markets. Through this initiative, the government aims also to provide opportunities to more entrepreneurs participate in boosting industrial economy. "I encourage entrepreneurs countrywide to acquire the TBS quality standard mark as way to promote their businesses locally and internationally," he said.
