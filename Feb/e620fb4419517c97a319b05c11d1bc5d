TWO fishermen who were fishing in Lake Tanganyika on the side of Kalambo District, Rukwa Region were rescued by seamen who were in a cargo ship sailing from neighbouring Burundi to Kigoma Port. Reliable sources from the scene had it that the incident occurred three days ago when the fishermen’s vessel was on the verge of capsizing after being carried away by the violent tides caused by strong winds as they were fishing in Lake Tanganyika. Kalambo District Commissioner (DC), Ms Julieth Binyura told the ‘Daily News’ during an exclusive interview held here that the duo fishermen were reported to have been rescued by seamen from the foreign cargo ship that was sailing on Lake Tanganyika from neighbouring country to Kigoma Port. She said the two fishermen whose names had not been established so far were seen fishing close to the Samazi village in the district. "While they were fishing reports had it that the lake was calm but suddenly weather turned violent, a downpour accompanied by strong winds hit the fishing boat they were in and pushed it further deep into the lake and it capsized. When they were struggling to save their lives, seamen in the foreign cargo ship spotted and rescued the duo,” added the DC.
