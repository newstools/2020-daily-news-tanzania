THIS article was prepared in response for telephone call and SMS from readers of this column from Ruaha National Park. Who wanted to get information about Nile crocodile who thrive on the banks of many rivers including the great Ruaha river which has a basin catchment area covering about 83,970 square kilometers, stretching for more than 475 kilometers long. The great Ruaha river is one large rivers which support life of different animals including Nile crocodiles. With an ugly morphology some people say the crocodiles are ancient animals who are foolish, lazy and slow in decision making and depend on river to bring them drought stricken prey who they kill and eat. Scientists say the Nile crocodile is a very smart predator who is able to use its aquatic environment and pose almost an inevitable danger to anyone who is crossing Grumeti river in Serengeti national park. In a period of 12 month a full grown lion is capable of killing between 15 and 18 wildebeests with each prey weighing between 160 to 185 kilograms whereby in a single seating a male lion will eat not less than 30 kilograms of meat. Nile Crocodile hunt few times in a year because they are equipped with biological system called Ectothermic which enable some reptilians and amphibians to regulate their body temperature and reduce amount of energy at a time of food scarcity so they may stay quite a long time without food as some scientists say they may eat in one season of a year and wait until its next turn. Scientists recently have discovered that in Grumeti river as Nile Crocodiles are waiting for the Impala, Zebra and Wildebeests during the annual migration they are able to endure long time without enough food by joining force in an army like section consisting between not less than 11 hunters who use their long and wide tails to force a swam of catfishes to tricky corner where they will be trapped. Then depending on age ranking system which is determined by body size the biggest crocodile will be allowed to go in the middle while others are waving their tail to stop the fish from coming out then depending on their contribution smaller members who will be allowed to go into the circle to have their share one at a time. Scientists say itâ€™s the responsibility of every individual on the banks of Ruaha River to understand and follow these rules or risk severe punishments from their elders who may even kill an opponent but it has been revealed that these big reptiles have specialised on hunting 20 different species of mammals including human being regardless of age and sex. As super predator who rules the water and fear only an adult hippopotamus who may weigh up to 1,800 kilograms but felines such as cheetah, leopard and lions who rules the savannah are nothing before the powerful jaws of an apex predator who know very much how to bury their long body under water and use the yellowish green colour with dark patches as a camouflage while their nostrils, eyes and ears which are placed on top of the upper side of the head for identifying position and type of prime prey to be snatched. In Serengeti national park an ambush from Nile crocodile is always slowly prepared and implemented in a speed of a blink as the reptiles come out of water like a flash and snatch a bull of wildebeest weighing 250 kilograms and drag it under the water where the mammal will be suffocated by the force of nature and die after five to ten minutes. Then its lifeless body will float on surface to invite crocodiles from all parts of the river to come and chop their portion in hierarchical order until the last part which is the head. In Serengeti National Park when many animals congregate on the side of Grumeti river the Nile Crocodiles will not launch an immediate attack but will go deep into the water where it will hide and hold their breath for 30 to 120 minutes while getting closer to the prey slowly up to a strategic location where it is possible to make a successful ambush. If an ambush from water fails to bear fruit Crocodiles will come out of water and chase their prey at a top speed of 12 to 14 kilometers per hour to strategic corner where they will be trapped and the strongest individual from the group will be asked to go and snatch a largest prey and drag it to the water where the ferocious reptiles will come together for feast using their long mouth armed with 68 sharp teeth. In Serengeti national park as the migration approaches its end and the number of wildebeests crossing the Grumeti river go down the smart individuals may wonder into the lower part of the river and consume meat from carcasses of wildebeests which were drown by water at the beginning of the season but if that is not enough they may get out of water and work slowly for 6 to 13 kilometers to look for prey. This is a most dangerous moment in their entire life because on their way out and back to Grumeti river they may encounter leopard or lions who know how to overpower the king of the lake and rivers of Africa by concentrating on turning the reptile upside down and launch their strikes to the lower part which is delicate resulting in loss of blood and a quick death. Scientists call them Crocodylus niloticus and they believe that Nile crocodiles are one of the oldest creatures to inhabit the planet Earth about 200 million years ago at the time when Dinosaurs where ruling the tropical forest but today Nile crocodiles dwell in rivers and lakes of 21 countries in Africa including Tanzania where the strongest population of 80,000 is believed to flourish in Selous game reserve while other national parks like Serengeti, Katavi, Rubondo Island and Saadani have a good number thanks to conservation policies by the government. rstanslaus@yahoo.com Mobile: 0754362330
