THE Ministry of Trade and Industries yesterday reaffirmed its commitment to mobilising citizens, including entrepreneurs, to establish small and medium industries to boost production and fight against poverty. Deputy Minister for Industries Hassan Khamis Hafidh, responding to Kijitoupele Representative Ali Suleiman Ali, said the country demanded small industries, leading to the establishment of pro-entrepreneurs institution—Zanzibar Micro, Small and Medium Industries Development Agency. The legislator, in his supplementary question, wanted to know the government’s strategies to mobilise citizens to invest in small industries. He said already some areas had been set aside for the construction of small industries, inviting interested Zanzibaris to invest, citing Dunga in Central Unguja District, which had been earmarked for the construction of small and medium industries.
