THE Revolutionary Government of Zanzibar has pleaded with former Federal Bank of Middle East’s (FBME) customers to patiently wait for payment of their deposits, which they have been longing for since the bank closure in 2014. The Bank of Tanzania (BoT) closed one of the largest banking institutions by then over charges of financially aiding terrorism. Finance and Planning Minister Mohamed Ramia Abdiwawa, responding to a question by Paje Representative Jaku Hashim Ayoub who wanted to know the government initiatives to ensure the bank depositors get their money, said the payments were delayed to another case filed in Cyprus. Minister Ramia gave hopes that the case is almost coming to an end and once the dispute is concluded, the bank depositors will be paid their dues. He however said that customers with below 1.5m/- balances with the bank have their payment arrangement concluded but depositors with above 1.5m/- balances have to wait because their payments are subject to the case verdict in Cyprus. “Liquidation always takes long period, it depends on completion of all cases filed by various people and institutions, including shareholders, employees and other stakeholders,” said Mr Ramia. On claims that the cases had been concluded, the minister said hitherto the government has no information on FBME having won any civil case against its liquidation and the union government is closely following up the matter through the central bank. The Deposits Insurance Board (DIB), Attorney General’s (AG) office in Zanzibar and solicitor general are engaged in deliberations with Cyprus’ central bank to address some of the challenges.
