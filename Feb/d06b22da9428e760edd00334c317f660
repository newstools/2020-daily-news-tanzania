ZANZIBAR Sugar Factory Limited has emptied its entire 3,000 tonnes of sugar stockpile, with the government guaranteeing the market for the product from the isles’ lone sweetener manufacturer. Marketing of Mahonda-based factory product had sparked mayhem, attracting the intervention of Prime Minister Kassim Majaliwa, who early this month banned sugar imports to Zanzibar to create market for the locally-produced product. Trade and Industries Minister Amina Salum Ali told the House of Representatives yesterday that: “ As I speak here, 3,000 tonnes have been bought, bringing to total 6,674 tonnes of production at Mahonda last year.” Presenting the government’s statement on the sugar factory in the House, Ms Salum Ali said: “ We are determined to purchase and consume all sugar from Mahonda Factory.” During the premier’s visit to the factory early this month, there was a pileup of 1,60 tonnes of unsold sugar, which was part of the investor’s January—December 2019 production of 6,674 tonnes. The minister told the House that the government through the cabinet had resolved to continually import sugar because Mahonda Factory could meet the country’s demand for only two months
