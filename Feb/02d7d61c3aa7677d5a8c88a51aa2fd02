REVENUES from Stone Town-based Beit Al Ajaeb building are expected to double to over 300m/-annually upon completion of the ongoing multibillion renovations, the House of Representatives was told here yesterday. Land, Water, Energy and Environment Minister, Salama Aboud Talib told the house that Africa’s iconic building is undergoing refurbishments that will cost over 12 million US dollars (over 28bn/-) to give it its deserved status. “This is an iconic historical building in Africa,” the minister said, adding that upon completion of renovation works, the building will have a highly attractive museum, which will attract thousands of visitors. Minister Aboud was answering a supplementary question by Jang’ombe Representative, Ramadhan Hamza Chande, who sought to know the amount of revenue that the government has lost in the past eight years as the building remained closed from tourist activities. The minister estimated the foregone earnings at between 1.2bn/-and 1.3bn/-, saying the structure used to generate an average of 150m/-, annually. Earlier, answering the main question by Chakechake Representative Suleiman Sarhan Said who wanted to get explanations on the delayed renovation works on the building, Deputy Minister for Land, Juma Makungu Juma attributed the delays to preparations of various documents, including the design. He further said communication between the project stakeholders—Zanzibar and Oman governments—on the technical renovation of the museum had also contributed to delays. Mr Makungu said rehabilitation works on the UN Education, Science and Culture Organisation certified building started on November 12, 2019, adding that the works’ first phase is scheduled for completion within 14 months. The entire project, he said, will take 27 months to complete and resume tourism business.
