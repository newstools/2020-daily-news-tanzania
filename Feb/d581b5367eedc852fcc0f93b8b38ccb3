DEPUTY Minister for Lands, Housing and Human Settlements Development, Dr Angelina Mabula, has directed the National Housing Corporation (NHC) to speed up the construction of Mwalimu Nyerere Memorial Hospital at Kwangwa in Mara Region. Dr Mabula directed this early this week during her tour of the project site to inspect its progress. The fifth phase government under President John Magufuli has provided 15bn/- to finance the construction of the health facility. The idea is to establish the referral hospital that offers services that have not been provided in the region. According to the Mara Regional Commissioner (RC) Adam Malima, the new hospital is expected to start providing medical services this year. It will be called Mwalimu Nyerere Memorial Hospital in remembrance of the founding father of the nation, Mwalimu Julius Nyerere. The construction of the hospital in Musoma Municipal Council began about 40 years ago, but stalled for many years due to financial constraints. The residents of Mara Region are grateful to the government for financing the construction of the hospital.
