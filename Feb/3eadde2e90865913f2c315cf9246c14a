THE Government has directed regional and district authorities in areas endowed with mineral resources to enlighten the general public on mining sector reforms undertaken by the fifth phase government to ensure the resources are beneficial to the country. Deputy Minister for Minerals, Mr Stanslaus Nyongo told the BBC in an interview on Saturday that for many years, the mining sector had been experiencing difficulties because members of the public were not well informed about the reforms and its benefits to the people. He said the situation had resulted in an uneasy relationship between locals and investors. Mr Nyongo said the decision by the fifth phase government under President John Magufuli to introduce the new mining laws aimed at creating a win-win situation between mining giants investing in the country and residents surrounding the mining areas was beneficial. ‘’One of the most significant implications of the new mining laws is that they empower the national assembly to allow the government to re-negotiate any agreement considered inequitable and containing unconscionable terms whereby other provisions allow the government to own at least 16 percent stake in mining companies operating in the country, and sharing of future economic benefits on a 50/50 basis." The deputy minister said the demonstrations by some members of the public adjacent to the mining areas experienced earlier were the consequence of attempts by politicians to gain cheap political mileage at the expense of national cohesion. Mr Nyongo noted that civic and constituency representatives should explain to their electorate that the public is not left in limbo as the government strives to make it clear how they are supposed to benefit from such resources countrywide. ‘’The councillors and legislators from mineral rich regions should be transparent and tell the public what they can benefit from such resources and what cannot according to various contracts reached instead of leaving the responsibility to government officials only,” he said.
