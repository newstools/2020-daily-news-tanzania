THE Parliament has joined the rest of world leaders to mourn the fallen Kenyan second president, Daniel arap Moi. The former teacher who became Kenya’s longest-serving President and transformed the country’s political landscape for more than two decades died at the Nairobi Hospital in the early hours of Tuesday. Speaker of the National Assembly Job Ndugai sent a message of condolence to the people of Kenya and the entire continent for losing an icon who stood firm for African people. According to Mr Ndugai, the Tanzanian parliament will always remember him for participating in the revival of the East African Community (EAC). “We will similarly not forget him because when he retired from the office of presidency, for us who were in parliament at that time we remember that he came to address us as a retired leader,’’ added Mr Ndugai. On Tuesday morning, President Uhuru Kenyatta of Kenya announced the demise of the former leader. “It is with profound sadness and sorrow that I announce the passing of a Great African Statesman, H.E. Daniel Toroitich arap Moi, the Second President of the Republic of Kenya. His Excellency the Former President passed on at the Nairobi Hospital on the early morning of this 4th February, 2020; in the presence of his family,” Mr Kenyatta said in a statement.
