CITY Council of Dodoma (CCD) is putting strategies in place to increase its annual revenues for 2020/2021 Fiscal Year, the City Council Director, Godwin Kunambi has said. Mr Kunambi told a recent council meeting that the City Council had developed seven ways to increase annual revenues, pointing out some of the strategies to include use of its ward executives to collect revenues in their responsible areas. He said the City Council will review all revenue sources to establish actual figures of revenue, saying the authorities will ensure all sources use electronic system of revenues collection. “The City Council will review all revenue sources in order to improve revenue loss management,” he said. Mr Kunambi mentioned the other strategy as improving auctions of Mpunguzi, Kikombo and Hombolo. “We will also set up a database for new plots in order to improve revenue collection,” he said. Mr Kunambi said the City Council made the decision to develop new strategies to improve revenue collection after recording poor collections, saying the collection declined to 116bn/- in 2020/2021 from 177bn/-. He said that the City Council of Dodoma was collected revenue amounting to 116bn/- from internal sources, central government and donor countries. Mr Kunambi attributed the drop in revenues collection to decrease of plot sales and natural resources. However, he said the new strategies will help the City Council to improve collection, saying they are determined to manage revenue loss. Mr Kunambi used the occasion to clarify on implementation of development projects up to December 2019 as part of the 2019/2020 Fiscal Year.
