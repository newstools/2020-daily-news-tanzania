UNGUJA Urban Combine team for people with disabilities have stepped up training for a friendly tournament to mark the universally of Union of people with disabilities in Zanzibar on February. The Chairman of the union of people with disabilities here, Hassan Silima told The 'Daily News' on Monday that the team has been conducting serious training daily at the Amaan Stadium for the event. “We have already started training for the special match against Unguja West A district team. We would like everyone to come and watch our players displaying incredible skills. There is a good entertainment there,” said Silima. He said despite its good start, the training session faces time challenges as most of the players who are schoolchildren fail to attend effectively the weekday fixture because they have to attend classes. Also facing similar challenge are schoolteachers who have been training alongside the youthful players. The chairman said the morale among the players is still high despite the challenges the exercise face. He said the overall winners of the tournament will be awarded silverware while the runners are entitled to walk out with silver medals.
