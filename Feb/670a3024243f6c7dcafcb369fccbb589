RETIRED President Benjamin Mkapa has lauded NMB bank for emerging as one of the strongest financial institutions that survived the privatisation wave during his administration shortly, when he assumed office in 1995. Speaking over the weekend in Mwanza, after launching his book titled ‘My Life, My Purpose’ to the Lake Zone residents, the third phase President said he took the tough stance to relieve public parastatals loss making and burden of subsidy. He said the decision involved the privatisation of NBC bank, hence the creation of NMB in 1997, adding that he was happy the bold action brought positive impact to the institution, and facilitated selling the government’s 49 percent shares to a consortium of strategic investors led by Rabobank Group in 2005. “I am happy to see that since then, NMB has registered steady growth and widen its focus to serving the common man, SMEs large corporates...basically catering for that need banking services,” he said. However, Mr Mkapa was irked by what he referred to as unfair criticisms by critics on his privatisation exercise, saying it was a must for his government to carry it out in order to save the hard earned tax payers’ money that could otherwise be used to subsidize the ailing public parastatals in serious financial troubles. “One thing that disappoints me most is when someone criticizes our privatisation of NBC, it is that they do not acknowledge how indebted it was reaching the point, where it was going to obtain a subsidy from the Treasury to keep operating; that is not what government revenues are for,” a paragraph in his book reads. Addressing the audience in Mwanza, NMB Acting Managing Director, Ruth Zaipuna congratulated the retired President for writing the book more especially mentioning NMB as a success story in privatization as a result of policy decisions carried out by Mkapa’s administration. She said that for the past 22 years in the privatization exercise, NMB has done a lot including managing to dish out over 1.2tril/-to support Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) as well releasing 2.2 trillion in loans disbursed to private entrepreneurs. On supporting farmers, Ms Zaipuna stated that this year, the bank aims to open more than 300,000 accounts (at no cost to farmers) in a bid to increase their financial inclusion and see into it that they are paid through the reliable banking systems, which also encourages them to prefer banking services. In a related development, Ms Zaipuna noted that her bank has been maintaining close collaboration with the government’s electronic payment system (GePG), where over 590 authority’s institutions have been integrated, hence facilitate collection of revenue amounting to over 2.1tril/-through NMB
