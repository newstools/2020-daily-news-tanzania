IN efforts to promote clean environment and avert communicable diseases, religious leaders in the country have been urged to help in promoting Water, Sanitation and Health (WASH) programme. The call was made here by the Minister for Health Mr Hamad Rashid Mohamed when he graced the opening of the national WASH stakeholders' meeting. "You are in a better position to push your followers to conserve the environment and promote sanitation," Mr Mohamed said as he thanked UNICEF for supporting the gathering organised by the 'Tanzania Interfaith Partnership (TIP).' He told participants including religious clerics from Isles and Tanzania mainland that they can be instrumental in crafting health messages positively linked to bible and Quranic verses or Christian and Islamic teachings on basic hygiene and personal cleanliness. "Be committed spreading these behaviour change messages in our communities through Sunday mass prayers and Friday prayers, community meetings and speeches," the Health Minister said adding that outbreaks like cholera can be controlled if people are well-aware and observe hygiene. The development of WASH advocacy is among key areas of discussions during the two-day meeting which aim at reminding members of the faiths that they can do a lot in promoting hygiene in the country.
