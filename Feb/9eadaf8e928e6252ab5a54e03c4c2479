GOVERNMENT Chemist Laboratory Authority (GCLA) has partnered with the Small Industries Development Organisation (SIDO) in attempt to reach out to large number of entrepreneurs in creating awareness on safe use of chemicals. The targeted entrepreneurs are those who engage in industrial-related activities such as making detergents, soaps and others. It came to light that the group was highly exposed to risks emanated from improper use of chemicals as raw materials for making their products. “It was very important to conduct seminar for these entrepreneurs for educating them over how to use chemicals safely and be aware of laws on chemical management,” Chief Government Chemist Dr Fidelice Mafumiko, noted. He was speaking on Tuesday at a seminar involved small entrepreneurs from different parts of Dar es Salaam. Dr Mafumiko noted that the authority was cautious over misuses of chemicals by some entrepreneurs; therefore they needed education to avoid such tendency. He told the participants that chemical, if misused, may cause effects to health and environment. Some of health effects include affecting respiratory system, causing abortion and others. On his part, trainer from SIDO, Mr George Buchafe, said they were normally focusing on encouraging entrepreneurs to initiate industries, while forgetting that proper use of chemicals was paramount. “We groom entrepreneurs to establish industries and we inspect whether the industries follow better production practices, but we find that they should also have knowledge on chemical use,” Mr Buchafe noted. One of participants, Ms Maria Lwilla, advised that the GCLA allocate its officials at SIDO specifically for offering education to entrepreneurs. Ms Lwilla, who manufactures detergents, raised concern that some retailers of chemicals were dishonest since they were selling expired chemicals to them.
