NATIONAL Assembly Speaker Job Ndugai has urged the judiciary to construct modern court facilities, especially in fastest-growing towns that will save time and resources for many years to come. He challenged the judiciary to embrace science and technology to improve access to justice in densely populated communities in the country. This was during the launch of Kondoa District Hospital in Dodoma. The district had for the past 49 years rented court facilities most of which were old. The newly launched hospital is projected to serve 500,000 residents of Kondoa and Chemba districts. According to Mr Ndugai, information and communication technology (ICT) not only helped to serve time and resources, but also increase transparency in court processes. “I must confess, I introduced ICT in Parliament and I can tell you things are much better ... technology is the future,” he said before launching the new facility. He noted that for years the country had witnessed old court structures, but with the new administration things had changed, showing the value for money approved by the parliamentarians. He assured Chief Justice, Prof Ibrahim Juma, of commitment to supporting the judiciary’s fiveyear plan 2017-2021 that sought to improve court infrastructure across the country. The modern court in Kondoa has been fixed with ICT systems to reduce time spent on filing and processing cases. Prof Juma said the judiciary was implementing its five years plan that assessed the situation of courts across the country. The judiciary roadmap depicts each area that needs a court. With effective investment in infrastructure, the CJ said the judiciary had so far requested more court officers to meet growing demand.
