THE Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries Development is expecting to increase the number of cows to four million in 2021/2022 Fiscal Year, from the current one million in order to have enough products of skin, meat and milk in the country. The ambitious plan was revealed on Tuesday by Deputy Minister for Livestock and Fisheries Development, Mr Abdallah Ulega when responding to a supplementary question posed by Lupembe MP Joram Hongoli (CCM). The legislator had demanded to know the governmentâ€™s plans to add the number of cows, especially in Njombe Region. Responding, Mr Ulenga said the government was well prepared to increase the number of livestock in all farms countrywide including Kitulo in Makete District and Sao Hill in Mufindi District in order to increase production. He said the government was equally intensifying cross breeding in order to have the best breed that can produce the best products. Earlier when responding to a supplementary question by Makete MP, Professor Norman Sigalla who wanted to know when the government would increase cows at Kitulo farm in Makete District which has the capacity to keep about 4,000 but currently there were only 750 cows. Mr Mpina said Kitulo Livestock Centre was the best centre in the country, having the best cows that were capable of producing the best meat and milk in the country that is why the government was putting every measure in place to improve that centre. The minister said he recently did a working tour at the farm and realised that there was a dire need for improvement of that centre so as to improve the dairy sector as well as to have enough meat production.
