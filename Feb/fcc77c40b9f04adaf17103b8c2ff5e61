THE Tanzania Share Index (TSI) remained bullish for a third consecutive week following a 0.54 per cent gain on the domestic market capitalization. The TSI at the end of the week that ended on 31st January 2020 was 3,464.43 points while the domestic capitalization stood at 9.098tri/-. The TSI gained 33.33 points since the beginning of the year to the end of January, while the domestic capitalization grew by 0.97 per cent. The rally on the TSI and domestic market cap originates specifically from the rally on the CRDB counter. The price of CRDB gained 18.18 per cent, moving from 110/- to 130/- during the week under review. The rally on CRDB was fueled by the bank’s annual results which reported 87 per cent growth in profits. The profit gain of CRDB was a result of increased interest income by 9.4 per cent as deposits and loan portfolio grew by 10.9 per cent and 8.4 per cent respectively. Interest expenses fell as the bank increases focus on retail customers who provide cheap deposits and take expensive loans while historically having highest payback ratio. CRDB moved 1.1mln shares during the week, realizing a turnover 139.55m/-. CRDB accounted for 4.9 per cent of the total turnover realized during the week. CRDB closed the week with outstanding bids of more than 9mln shares while there was zero offers. Bids keep mounting due to restrictive price determination rules by DSE which do not allow price movement of more than 10 per cent in a single trading session. The result is investors are willing to pay than the highest accepted price of 140/- and holders believe that they can sell at more than what is allowable in the market while the market rules cannot accommodate both, hence a price limbo. In Kenya and Uganda, price restrictions are removed during corporate events announcements, especially releases of financial statements. May be it is high time we adopt a similar approach. Apart from CRDB, NMB also had a good year during 2019. NMB grew profits by 52 per cent mainly as a result of a 28.5 per cent decline in impairment expenses and increased non-interest income by 14 per cent. Interest income slightly grew by 4 per cent while interest expenses went up 17 per cent. Despite a significant increase in profits, NMB counter remained quiet during the week. The main reason for the rigidity on NMB counter is similarly the trading rules. The total turnover realized during the week was 2.86bn/-, down 84 per cent compared to the previous week. The total volume during the week was 1.6mln shares. TBL remained the top mover, accounting for 88.7 per cent of the total realized equity turnover during the week. TBL moved 317,350 shares most through off market block transactions at a price of 8,000/- despite TBL long standing market closing price of 10,900/-. The All Share Index (DSEI) gained 21.76 points to 2,112.77 points following a 1.04 per cent increase in the total market capitalization. The growth on the total capitalization results from an increase in cross listed prices led by NMG which grew by 3.8 per cent. Foreign investors dominated the market while remaining net sellers. Foreign investment accounted for 82 per cent while foreign divestment accounted for 88.5% of the total divestments. Local investors accounted for the balance.
