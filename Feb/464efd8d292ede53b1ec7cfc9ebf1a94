TRADE and Industries Minister, Ambassador Amina Salum Ali, has predicted a bright future for Zanzibar, thanks to the government's spearheaded economic reforms. Ambassador Ali said there are a lot of indicators that Zanzibar is on track towards achieving development goals mainly in industries, fishing and farming. "Our revived textile factory (COTEXT) is in progress, market for spices like lemongrass- Cymbopogon; Seaweed and fish sardines has been increasing, and other light factories are in pipeline. These are clear indicators of a bright future," Ms Ali. The minister informed the 'Daily News' that the government is sparing no efforts in ensuring there is favourable environment for investment by establishing industries and Agriculture to produce more standard goods. "This is an opportunity for people in Zanzibar particularly Women and increasing unemployed youths. The industries provide employment, but youth and women can get self-employed by growing spices and vegetables because the demand has been growing." She said Zanzibar still has many under-utilized resources for example in the sea and farming, but the people here mainly the youth are not using the opportunity. "I encourage the young people to be innovative and creative; It is possible to get out of poverty and contribute to economic growth."
