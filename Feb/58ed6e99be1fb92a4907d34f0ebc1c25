THE government has called upon innovators to register their work to identify locally developed technologies, which can improve economy. The call was issued here yesterday by Eng Tabotha Etutu at the Department of Science, Technology and Innovation while announcing the 2020 National Competition of Science, Technology and innovation, abbreviated as MAKISATU in Kiswahili. She said that the government acknowledges a lot of innovation projects undertaken by many talented young people in the country, which if adopted would help in economic development. Eng Etutu added that this year’s MAKISATU climax would be marked at the Jamhuri Stadium from March 16th to 20th, and estimated to attract more than 500 entries as participants from Primary, Secondary, Tertiary Colleges, Vocational Trainings and Universities submitting their innovation works. “The aim of the competition is to identify, nurture and develop innovators, who if well groomed can help catalyze economic development, as the country gears for industrial economy by 2025,” she said. She further said that during the 2019 competition the government identified 415 young innovators, where 60 of them were empowered in different projects to reach commercial level. However, she commended host institutions for working closely with the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology to groom many young Tanzanians with great innovative skills. “We are aware that there a lot of innovative skills, which once identified and nurtured, the final goal would help improve national development and create jobs,” said Eng Etutu.
