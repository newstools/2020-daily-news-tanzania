ZANZIBAR government authorities yesterday promised to spare no effort in ensuring that business and investment environment is favourable for all investors and that the existing challenges in the archipelago will soon turn to be issues of the past. “We are fully committed to end the challenges hampering the development of your businesses in the tourism industry,” said Minister for Information, Tourism and Heritage Mr Mahmoud Thabit Kombo in response to complaints raised by visiting officers from the Association of Italian Tour Operators. The delegation from Association of Italian Tour Operators (AITO)-’ASTOI Confindustria V iaggi’ led by brand director Mr Franco Campazzo and ‘Neos Air Italian Charter’ officer Ms Antonella Balestra mentioned challenges they face while in Zanzibar. ASTOI brings to Zanzibar more than 120 tourists annually. She cited problems that include the invasive presence of beach boys and constant pressure from taxation officers, poor roads; inappropriate waste management; and insecurity in some areas of the islands as bandits ambush tourists, steal and in most cases injure the victims. Flanked by officers from Immigration, Tourism Commission, Airport, Zanzibar Revenue Board (Z RB), Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA), and Permanent Secretaries Information, Tourism and Heritage Ms Khadija Bakar and the Finance’s Mr  Khamis Mussa, Minister Kombo promised that the challenges would be addressed. Mr Kombo said there was an ongoing huge investment of over 200 million US dollars to improve Zanzibar airport which includes expansion, construction of a new terminal, runway and airport apron, which will solve problems like congestion and immigration clearance delays. “Most of the main roads are under construction, and waste management is being considered, while the police is taking measures to guarantee security in all tourists attractions sites,” Kombo said as the Finance PS Mr Mussa welcomed further discussions on how to end mistrust between investors and tax collectors
