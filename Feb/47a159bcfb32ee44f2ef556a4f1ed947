UGANDAN Minister for East African Community Major General (Rtd) Kahinda Otafiire vowed to pep up the regional integration process as he took over his new role of an Ex-Officio member of the East African Legislative Assembly (EALA). The retired military officer cum politician who was sworn in late on Monday, assured EALA members of commitment to ensure integration is realized. “I promise to work hard to strengthen EAC integration to ensure the dreams of our forefathers become a reality,” assured Mr Otafiire. The Ugandan minister was sworn in by the Clerk to the Assembly at a brief ceremony witnessed by the Speaker and Members of EALA in line with the Rule 5 of the Rules and Procedures of the Assembly. The Rule says in part that: “No Member can sit or participate in the proceedings of the House until the Oath or Affirmation of Allegiance to the Treaty is taken”. Rule 5(5) specifically states that: “when a Member first attends to take his or her seat other than at the first Sitting of a new House, he or she shall be brought to the table by two Members and presented by them to the Speaker who shall then administer the Oath or Affirmation of Allegiance”. Major General (Rtd) Otafiire replaces his counterpart, the second Deputy Prime Minister, Dr Ali Kirunda Kivenjija who moved to the Office of the President. The newly appointed Minister has held several government portfolios including the ministerial docket at the Constitutional and Legal Affairs Ministry. His appointment as EALA’s Ex Officio took place during the regional assembly’s Third Meeting of the Third Session which is ongoing here in Arusha. Article 49 of the EAC Treaty establishes EALA as the legislative organ of the Community. Like most legislatures EALA has as its core functions legislating, oversight and representation. There are currently 45 EALA members, indirectly elected for a five-year renewable term by their respective National Assemblies and five ex-officio members.
