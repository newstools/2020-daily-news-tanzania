KVZ Head Coach, Mohamed Seif Kingi has officially written a resignation letter to the club following his team’s dismal show in the ongoing Zanzibar Premier League. Kingi, who officially submitted his resignation on February 10th to the club’s head of administration, said he failed to perform to the desired capacity. Kingi said he didn’t achieve what the club wanted him to do, hence he decided to part ways. “I am a responsible coach, I have decided to take a rest after failing to meet what the management wanted from me as a target,” he stressed. Kingi took charge of the team early this season replacing Sheha Khamis who had served the team for three seasons. He too failed to give the club the much needed Isles league championship. With Khamis in charge, KVZ managed to finish runner up three times, but never won the championship title, a situation that forced the management to fire him. KVZ are placed at the eighth position in the Zanzibar Premier League after posting 18 points. KMKM, who are the Zanzibar Premier League’s defending champions, are leading the table with 30 points. Just a point behind leaders KMKM, are Mlandege at the second place with 29 points. Jang’ombe Boys are position seventh also 18 points like KVZ while Zimamoto at the third position after collecting 28 points.
