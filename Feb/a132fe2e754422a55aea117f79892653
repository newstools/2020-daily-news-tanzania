KVZ punished defending champions KMK with a convincing 2-0 victory in the Isles Premier League game staged here at Amaan Stadium late Tuesday. The highly competitive game saw both teams playing fast but entertaining football that appealed football fans who thronged at the venue. It was KVZ first victory under their new coach Ali Bakar Mngazija, who has just replaced their former coach Mohammed Seif Kingi, who parted ways with the club last week. KVZ, who shared spoils with Mafunzo prior to facing KMKM, started the game with cracking pace but they made carefully planned raids at KMKM, and they managed to score both goals in before the breather. Maabad Maulid Maabad was the match hero as he scored both goals for his youthful side. It took KVZ 26 minutes to open their goal account through Maabad who added the second just two minutes before the end of the first half. The victory has earned KVZ 22 points. Under the tutelage of Ameir Msimu and his assistant Hassan Othman Kingi, KMKM lost concentration after conceding the two goals. In their attempt to regain composure, KMKM called in Salum Akida for Is-haka Saidi Mwinyi, but the substitution didnâ€™t help them much. The loss has forced KMKM to settle at the second position with 31 points in the league whose current leaders are Mlandege with 32 points. At Gombani stadium in Pemba, Machomanne handed Mwenge a 3-0 blitz in a thrilling Isles Premier League encounter.
