SAND mining in Zanzibar will remain under tight regulations to protect the islands and their people against the adverse effects of environmental degradation, the House of Representatives heard here on Thursday. Deputy Minister for Agriculture, Tourism, Livestock and Fisheries, Dr Makame Ali Ussi, reminded the House of some islands, which have sunken due to environmental ruin, saying the government will not allow similar risks to Zanzibar. “The security of our islands and people are of critical importance, we cannot allow sand mining everywhere,” Dr Ali told the House, noting that the current Mwanakwerekwe dam is a product of haphazard sand mining. He said the revolutionary government had a special plan for sustainable use of sand resource in the country, ruling out any arrangement to allow individuals to import sand from outside Zanzibar. The deputy minister was answering a question by Konde Representative Omar Seif Abeid who wanted to know the government’s plan to allow sand importation to Zanzibar. He said the government had long-term plans on sand management, explaining that procedures for huge government projects, investors and individual citizens to get sand are among key features of the plans. Dr Ali said the ministry had allocated Selem area in Pemba for the government and investment projects while Mamoja Uondwe site will serve citizens. For Unguja, Fujoni sand mining site serves the government, investors and citizens’ construction projects, the lawmakers were told.
