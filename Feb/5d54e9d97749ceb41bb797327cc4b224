TANZANIA Cooperative Development Commission (TCDC) is appealing to regional and district assistant registrars to accord maximum cooperation to security organs in scrutinizing members who are wishing to vie for leadership in cooperative unions. Acting Deputy Registrar of Cooperative Unions, Mr Charles Malunde said in a press statement issued here on Saturday that scrutiny was being conducted in order to get qualified leaders. “Assistant registrars and officials of cooperatives at district levels should ensure that security organs are involved in scrutiny. The cooperation will help us get sincere and ideal leaders,” read part of the statement issued by Communications Unit of TCDC. Mr Malunde noted that 2020 is election year in cooperatives, urging members to elect ideal and qualified leaders who will protect properties of the cooperatives. “In order to ensure the cooperatives get leaders who will make significant contribution in the cooperatives, we must cooperate amongst ourselves to get the leaders,” he said. Mr Malunde said elected unscrupulous leaders in cooperatives will result in cooperatives becoming bankrupt, saying a common member of a cooperative union may accuse the government, not knowing that they are responsible for electing the leaders. “We should restore the tarnished image of cooperative unions. Members can play a key role to restore the good image,” he said. While in Njombe recently, Deputy Minister for Agriculture, Mr Hussein Bashe, issued directives on the return of cooperatives’ properties which were stolen by dishonest leaders. He gave the directives following the return of Lupembe Cooperative Union properties thanks to TCDC in conjunction with security organs. Mr Bashe cited some of the properties which were returned as a Mitsubishi Canter, a Toyota Land Cruiser, an Escudo and two vehicle engines as well as a tea leaves production plant.
