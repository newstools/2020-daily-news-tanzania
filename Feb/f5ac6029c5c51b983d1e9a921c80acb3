SPEAKER of the Parliament Job Ndugai has emphasized on the need to Dodoma city authorities to ensure that they set up stateof-the-art golf course to match with its growing status. Speaker Ndugai made this remarks during the official launching of a robust Master Plan for Dodoma City on Thursday. “As we plan this city, we must make sure that we demarcate open spaces for sports. It is also important to ensure that a state-of-the-art golf course is constructed in Dodoma to allow not only Diplomats but also citizens to have time to play the sport,” insisted Ndugai. He recalled that several years back a speaker from a foreign nation had visited him (Ndugai) and requested that he needed a time out to play golf but couldn’t. “It was embarrassing because I had come with an excuse,” said Ndugai. Four years ago, the Tanzania People’s Defence Forces (TPDF) Lugalo Club announced that they are finalising plans to construct the first ever golf course in the country’s capital of Dodoma. The move is the fifth phase government’s idea to ensure all its institutions and ministries shift to Dodoma before the year 2020. TPDF Lugalo Club Chairman, Brigadier General retired Michael Luwongo said that Dodoma has been the top priority and they have already secured a 250-hectre land in Dodoma for the intended modern course. This will be the second course to be constructed by TPDF after Lugalo that was founded by retired General George Waitara ten years ago. Luwongo said: “I am happy to announce that TPDF has already secured a plot to construct the golf course, it is about two kilometres from Dodoma town along Dodoma-Singida road. “We are also planning to have modern course to be designed in Lugalo course style and this is good opportunity for those who want to join hand and invest in the course."
