HIGH Court Judge in Charge in Mwanza Region Sam Rumanyika has urged the judiciary to speed up access to justice that will in turn facilitate investment and businesses in the country. Judge Rumanyika made the call on Thursday, at the Law Week ceremony in Mwanza City, saying it was unfair for the judicial system to delay justice because the trend discouraged members of the public and made them fail to concentrate effectively on their activities. He said all court officers and stakeholders –lawyers, magistrates, state attorneys, judges and members of the public-to ensure they worked hard to ensure court judgments were pronounced as soon as possible and without favour or fear. “If a court does not dispense timely justice, it can discourage even potential foreign investors. I am therefore calling on court officers and stakeholders to cooperate and work hard to end drawbacks that impede access to justice,” said Judge Rumanyika. He said the use of information and communication technology had increased efficiency and this assured members of the public to trust the judiciary that they were determined to ensure rights were given at the right time. For his part, Mwanza Region Commissioner (RC), John Mongella, commended the efficiency of courts in Mwanza Region in dispensing justice timely, thanks to changes that had been made in the court system. He said since court worked to the satisfaction of community members, they would increase their trust in the judiciary, something which might yield positive results. “I commend you for your efforts to dispense justice speedily, thereby sparing members of the public of undue inconveniences," said Mr Mongella
