HAVING a few number of immigration officers at different embassies in foreign countries does not deter Tanzanians from getting passports. The government stated on Tuesday that the available officials were enough to facilitate the availability of the crucial travel documents. Deputy Minister for Internal Affairs, Hamad Masauni made the remark when responding to Tarime Rural lawmaker, John Heche (CHADEMA) who quizzed the government as to when immigration officials would be appointed to serve in the foreign states. The backbencher equally wanted to know if officials present at the embassies were able to provide travel documents to Tanzanians. According to Mr Masauni different officers serving at different embassies had been provided with crucial training for the registration and issuance of travel documents to Tanzanians residing in their respective countries of service, insisting that their number was not a big deal. He said currently, plans were afoot to appoint officers who would soon be deployed to embassies abroad in order to issue passports to those in need, and that even as the procedures were still ongoing, the passports were being provided by a few number of officers who are currently working in embassies. However, he insisted, thanks to an online system established by the immigration department, people were able to apply online for e-passports, e-visa, e-permit and e-gate, among others by filling in the forms electronically.
