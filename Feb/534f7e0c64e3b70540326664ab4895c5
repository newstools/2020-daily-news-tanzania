THE government says it is yet to receive any official communication from the US government on the visa restrictions it has reportedly imposed on Tanzanians and therefore it cannot give any comment. According to the Communication Officer from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and East African Co-operation, Mr Emmanuel Buhohela (pictured), no official communication has been made with regard to the move from the US government. “We have seen reports in various social media platforms just like you. We have not received any official information from the US government as far as the decision is concerned. We, therefore, cannot work on media reports,” Mr Buhohela said. According to the reports, the US government said it was restricting immigrants from six additional countries that failed to meet minimum security standards, as part of an election year push to further clamp down immigration. According to the decision, Tanzania, along other five nations - Kyrgyzstan, Myanmar, Eritrea, Nigeria, and Sudan will face new restrictions in obtaining certain visas to enter the US. However, according the announcement, the decision is not a total travel ban. “It is fundamental to national security, and the height of common sense that if a foreign nation wishes to receive the benefits of immigration and travel to the United States, it must satisfy basic security conditions outlined by America’s law enforcement and intelligence professionals,” the statement from US government read
