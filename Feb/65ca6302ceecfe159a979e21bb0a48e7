FARMERS across the country may now heave a sigh of relief as the prices of fertilizers have dropped with the most dependable UREA fertilizer’s cost recording a significant reduction of almost ten per cent. This is attributed to the efficiency of various measures undertaken by the government, including implementation of the Bulk Procurement System. In the 2018/19 farming season, UREA fertilizer, which is mostly applied by farmers across the country through the top dressing method in their readily sown crops, was trading at 57,500/- per bag weighing 50 kilogrammes but now agricultural input costs 51,700/- per bag. This was revealed by Minister for Agriculture Japhet Hasunga on Wednesday in Dar es Salaam when speaking to reporters on the status of availability of fertilizers in the country. According to the minister, the prices of fertilizers dropped from an average price of 54,000/- in July last year to 51,700/- in November last year, a decrease of 2,300/-, equivalent to four per cent. Minister Hasunga said that fertilizer demand for 2019/2020 farming season is 586,604 tonnes, noting that until February 18 this year, the availability was 491,659 tonnes, equivalent to 84 per cent of the country’s demand. Between July 1, last year and February 18 this year, a total of 17,832 tonnes of fertilizer and fertilizer supplements were produced in the country, of which 17,157 tonnes were produced by Minjingu Company and other companies while 675 tonnes of fertilizer supplements was produced by Tanga based ABM company. However, a total of 305,729 tonnes of different types of fertilizers were imported, including 94,325 tonnes of UREA and 57,410 tonnes of ADP, equivalent to 50 per cent of all fertilizers imported into the country. The minister said that between July 2019 and February 18 this year, the availability of UREA was 136,163 tonnes while that of DAP was 100,720 tonnes. Other imported fertilizer included NPK , SA, CAN, MoP and micronutrient fertilizers. More than 70,000 tonnes, including 8,800 tonnes of DAP and 58,357.254 tonnes of UREA, were expected to be delivered to the country in the third week of February this year. The arrival of the consignment will make the availability of fertilizer to be more than 100 per cent of the country’s demand, thus guaranteeing enough stock of the crop nutrients for the entire 2019/20 farming season. Mr Hasunga further said that the UREA consignment arrived in the country on January 24 this year and was distributed to upcountry regions. He noted that indicative prices in Dar es Salaam warehouses (DSM ex-warehouse price) will be 43,104/- for not less than 30 tonnes of fertilizer. The minister said that wholesale prices will be available at every selling point for not less than five tones. He said the retail indicative price for UREA in Eastern, Central, Southern and Northern zone regions will be between 44,800/- and 53,000/- while for the western zone, Southern highlands and Lake zone will be between 50,000/- and 53,000/-. Mr Hasunga said that the prices will be effective from February 20 this year and will be applicable until the government announces new cap prices. “It should be noted that these are ceiling prices at the warehouses levels, wholesale and retail in a respective area,” he said, adding that suppliers can sell the fertilizer even below the indicative prices.
