At least 50 people are feared dead after a gold mine collapsed in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, local authorities said Saturday. The accident occurred on Friday afternoon in the town of Kamituga in South Kivu province following heavy rains. Photos and videos on social media showed hundreds of people, some of whom could be heard wailing on a hillside around the mine-shaft entrance.
