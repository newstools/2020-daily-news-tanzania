AIR Tanzania Company Limited (ATCL) has resumed flights between Dar es Salaam and Hahaya in Comoro after being suspended for five months due to the outbreak of Covid-19. The national carrier suspended flights to the island in March this year after the Comoros government shut down its airspace after the Covid-19 outbreak. ATCL Chief Executive Officer, Eng Ladisalus Matindi said that ATCL will make its trips twice on Tuesday and Sunday, and later will increase frequencies as the situation continues to improve. “We thank the government of the Comoros Islands through its embassy for their cooperation with ATCL, which enabled them to make special trips to transport passengers and cargo to the islands during the Covid-19 shutdown period,” Eng Matindi said through a statement yesterday. However, all passengers who intend to travel to Hahaya are required to have a special certificate confirming that they have undergone Covid-19 tests and to register at the Comoros embassy before purchasing tickets. “We truly thank our customers for their patience and understanding throughout the Covid-19 disaster period,” Mr Matindi said. During the pandemic period, ATCL had also operated a number of repatriation charter flights, while it currently continues to operate local flights in at least 11 airports. Before Covid-19 lockdown, ATCL, the national flag carrier and the third largest carrier in East Africa, was flying to seven regional and 13 domestic destinations.
