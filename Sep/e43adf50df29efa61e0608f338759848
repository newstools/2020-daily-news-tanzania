CCM parliamentary candidate in Bukoba Urban Constituency, Stephen Byabato has promised to offer free legal aid services to the residents, if elected to the National Assembly on October 28th this year. Mr Byabato made the pledge during a campaign rally at Hamugembe Ward on Wednesday, adding that most of his efforts would also be dedicated to uplifting the area Dispensary to a Health Centre. “As an Advocate of the High Court of Tanzania, I have the capacity to assist needy people including women, widows and youths, and offer them free legal services,” he said. In his pledges, he also said he would backup reinforcement of barriers to control the Kanoni River banks, which had been causing a lot of problems to Bukoba Municipal residents through frequent bursts and flooding. The well-attended meeting was also attended by former Bukoba Urban MP, Ambassador Khamis Kagasheki (2005-2010), who appealed to Tanzanians not to make mistakes during the October 28th General Election, but choose right leaders wisely. He noted that CCM was the only party capable of addressing challenges in the community and people’s problem, and hence, urged them to vote in favour of presidential candidate, Dr John Magufuli. Ambassador Kagasheki explained that Dr Magufuli was expected to arrive in Bukoba Municipality on September 15th 2020 and urged the residents to attend his campaign in big numbers at the Gymkhana grounds.
