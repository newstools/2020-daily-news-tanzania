THE Rotary Club of Dar es Salaam Sunset has donated 600 exercise books to the city’s Mbuyuni Primary School pupils as a part of celebrations of basic education and literacy month (September). Speaking after donating those books, President Elect Deborah Da Silva said the reason for choosing Mbuyuni  Primary School is the facility is close to their club's heart. She added that the club launched its first educational project at the school. "During 2019 the club put a lot of efforts to raise funds so that the school pupils could have access to clean drinking water and in January 2020, following the club's efforts and a generous donation from Rotary Club of Hereford in England, the school was gifted with a brand new water filtration pump. "We also painted and donated books for a new library room, which was much needed. Basic Education is essential for a country’s economic growth. Literacy is a key factor of an individual’s success and collectively a community’s success,” Deborah said. On her side, the former President Farhat Lane said children's early years are the foundation for future development and a strong base for lifelong learning, cognitive and social development. She added Rotary has seven areas of focus that includes, Basic Education and literacy, peace and conflict prevention/ resolution, disease prevention and treatments, water and sanitation, maternal and child health, economic and community development and the environment. “Our fundraising activities define how we run our club, we always look to bring fun and enjoyment to all our events, helping our community with a smile, the Sunset way," she added.
