TANZANIA Communications Regulatory Authority (TCRA) and the Universal Communication Service Access Fund (UCSAF) in the Lake Zone have urged providers of telecommunications services to share transmission towers for efficient service delivery. Speaking to representatives from electronic media, radio, TV and online networks Chief of TCRA in the Lake Zone Francis Mihayo said for telecommunications service providers to cooperate to ensure better service delivery. He said if all service providers cooperated they would provide services to many people efficiently since cooperation among different firms in the telecommunications sector had a positive impact. Mr Mihayo said sharing telecommunications towers helped to reduce operational and installation costs which were high. He challenged mobile operators in the Lake Zone to improve the provision of services since the reception was below 50 per cent. “Join your efforts so that you can deliver to our people and this will only be possible if you cooperate and avoid greed in discharging your duties,” said Mr Mihayo. Head of Finance Department of UCSAF Pius Joseph said another reason for the meeting was to make stakeholders in the telecommunications sector in the Lake Zone to understand that through the support of UCSAF 631 wards out of 994 had been covered with telecommunications services.
