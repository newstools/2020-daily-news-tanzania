REGIONAL irrigation engineers have been instructed to speed up various programmes to increase irrigated areas from 694,715 hectares to one million hectares by 2025. Speaking during the opening of a two-day meeting for the management and irrigation engineers of the National Irrigation Commission on Wednesday, Permanent Secretary (PS) in the Ministry of Agriculture Gerald Kusaya said it was high time for all irrigation engineers in the country to focus on putting in place effective plans to implement government plans. “The goal of the fifth phase government in irrigation is to ensure 1,000,000 hectares are irrigated by 2025. We should ask ourselves, are we on track? Have we done enough?” asked Mr Kusaya. In his opening remarks, the PS noted that the Ministry of Agriculture wanted the Irrigation Commission to focus more on addressing infrastructure challenges so that farmers could produce more crops to create food security in the country. He commended the Irrigation Commission for successfully expanding the area by constructing and rehabilitating 179 irrigation schemes and successfully increasing irrigated areas from 461,000 hectares in 2015 to 694,715 hectares in 2020. The PS added that productivity had increased irrigation schemes from an average of 1.8- 2.0 tonnes per hectare to an average of 4.0-5.0 tonnes per hectare for rice and maize production increased from 1.5 tonnes to 3.7- 5.0 tonnes per hectare. Mr Kusaya also instructed the regional irrigation engineers and all members of staff to be more productive and responsible. For his part, Acting Director General of the National Irrigation Commission David Kaali said they had successfully increased rice production through irrigation schemes from 714,000 tonnes in 2000 to 2,009,174 tonnes in 2019 due to improved infrastructure. He also said to achieve the target of one million hectares by 2025 the Commission would develop irrigation schemes in the Ruvuma River Basin (26,000), Ruhuhu River (3,700), Songwe River (3,005), Rufiji River (64,896), Luiche Kigoma Basin (3,000) and the Usangu- Mbeya basin (10,000) over the next five years, 2021-2025.
