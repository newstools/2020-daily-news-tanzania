THE Head of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Tanzania (ELCT), Bishop Frederick Shoo, has appealed to the National Electoral Commission (NEC) to create a conducive environment for people with disabilities to participate in the General Election scheduled for October 28, this year. He made the call over the weekend, in Moshi, Kilimanjaro region, while officiating the opening of Olympic Games for children with disabilities from Moshi municipality. “People living with disabilities are our fellow human beings, they are citizens like us, they have clear and sound minds which can make them do everything which their peers can do; therefore NEC must make sure they have a conducive environment for enabling them to participate in elections as their peers who are physically fit,” he said. Dr Shoo, who doubles as the head of the Northern Diocese of the ELCT further said that NEC should also ensure that there is a conducive environment for people with disabilities to participate in the elections right from the campaign phase, through to polling day, as well as when the results would be released. "NEC should also make sure that it puts in place mechanisms for enabling people with disabilities, including the deaf and blind, fulfill their constitutional rights of choosing the leaders they want,” added Bishop Shoo. Speaking during the event, the coordinator of ELCT-ND’s Building a Caring Community (BCC) Unit, Rev Anna Makyao, said that the institute seeks to train and empower children living with disabilities to become self- reliant when they become adults. “Currently we have 281 children being raised in various facilities and at their respective homes, whereby we ensure their safety, as well as providing them with education, health services, physical therapy services depending on the type of one’s disability status”, she said. She commended various donors from within and outside the country for their commitment, which ensured that BCC achieved its goal of serving children.
