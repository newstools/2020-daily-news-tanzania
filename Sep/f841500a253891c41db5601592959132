JOB opportunities are expected to increase, thanks to a project to boost entrepreneurship and vocational training. The project, entitled ‘Better Education for Africa’s Rise II (BEAR II)’ is implemented by Zanzibar Ministry of Education and Vocational through its Vocational Training Authority (VTA), supervised by The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (Unesco) with funds from South Korea. “This is an important project as it aims at increasing job opportunities by supporting the development of entrepreneurship and vocational training,” Dr Idrisa Muslih Hija said at a meeting with stakeholders. He urged members of the public, including graduates from higher learning institutions, to support the project by getting enrolled with seriousness, as the government worked closely with development partners to support the growth of Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET). VTA Executive Director Bakar Ali Silima said the 2017-2021 project involved the provision of equipment at Karume Institute of Science and Technology (KIST) and improve the Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) policy towards having a modern vocational training centre. Unesco Head of the Education Sector Dar es Salaam Office Faith Shayo said the BEAR II project implemented in five countries of East Africa had been designed to update curricula and enhance the capacity of trainers. “The project also includes improving TVET institutions, boosting infrastructure and engaging employers and enterprises in helping TVET to focus on specific sectors. The BEAR II project also aims at increasing people’s access to quality TVET, with a focus on young people and also change the perception of vocational training as it is for students who fail in mainstream education,” Ms Shayo said. She said the project also aimed at developing entrepreneurs and vocational students to use information communication technology, mainly how they could advertise and sell their products online at this period when finding markets remained a challenge due to Covid-19.
