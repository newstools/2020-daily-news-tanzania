Ousted Mali president Ibrahim Boubacar Keita was hospitalized on Tuesday, days after he was released from detention by the military junta that remains in power. The 75-year-old and his Prime Minister Boubou Cisse were arrested alongside other government officials after the military took power on 18 August following weeks of protests in the West African country. Keita was held in detention for 10 days, with the military justifying the move saying it was necessary for his own security. A report by the AP now says he was admitted late on Tuesday for an unknown condition, and it remains unclear whether he would be transferred abroad for specialized treatment. The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) led other countries and organizations in condemning Keitaâ€™s ouster by the military, but thousands of Malians took to the streets on Friday to show their support for it. The West African bloc has called upon the military junta to transfer power to a civilian transitional government ahead of elections. Keita, who was first elected in 2013, still had three years left in his term.
