OVER eight million customers with Vodacom M-Pesa accounts will receive 3.5bn/- share profit accumulated on M-Pesa trust accounts as reward from using the service. The eligible customers for the interest are the ones who transacted between January and March this year. Vodacom Tanzania Director of M-Commerce, Epimack Mbeteni said the profit will be paid to all individual customers, retail agents and other MPesa business partners who will receive payments basing on their M-Pesa wallet transactions. “We have seen substantial growth on the M-Pesa platform with more customers, agents, merchants and institutions transacting more than 100bn/- through M-Pesa each day. We are happy with the growth which is why today we can disburse 3.5bn/- in interest to our customers,” he said. Vodacom Tanzania, listed on Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange (DSE), has over 11 million customers on its MPesa platform commanding a market share of 39 per cent, according to recent TCRA figures. Vodacom Tanzania has so far paid out a total of 133bn/- as interest to its MPesa customers. Mr Mbeteni added that the profit share per customers is calculated as per Bank of Tanzania (BoT) circular and will depend on the level of activity they would have had on M-Pesa for the said period and started to be distributed this Tuesday. The Vodacom M-Pesa platform is offering tailor made products suited for the local market which have increased financial inclusion and stimulated economic activities across Tanzania.
