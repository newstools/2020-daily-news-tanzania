THE Minister for Minerals, Doto Biteko has urged Business Registration and Licensing Agency (BRELA) to continue to adhere to professionalism in their daily activities and fight the challenges of dishonest people who pretend to be their staff (vishoka) and disturb business community. He said those unscrupulous people have been embarrassing business people, who need to register business names and companies by asking corruption something that discourages others who need to start business. The Minister gave the advice when he visited BRELA pavilion during the ongoing mineral exhibitions at Bombambili grounds in Geita. “I congratulate BRELA because you managed to solve ghost companies and conflict within many companies but there is another remaining problem of those dishonest people in internet you must work hard to make sure they don’t exist,” he said. He also congratulated BRELA for the good cooperation with his ministry and promises to continue working together for the benefit of Tanzanians. He cited one example of conflict which was solved by BRELA as Nyarugusu mineral company. Biteko said online registration system that is currently used by BRELA has helped things to move smoothly and reduce many challenges that were facing business during the registration of new business and business names. He said it is the government expectations to see minerals business people especially small miners use companies in their daily activities instead of using their names as it is the trend now.
