Mr Kinana praised the good work that was being done by President John Magufuli, saying that party members, who are contesting for various posts in this election have a lot to learn from him. “Our country has achieved a lot in these five years in different sectors and the reason behind these huge strides is that we have a president who is committed to serve our country.
