Either the statement said for any shareholder member who did not receive the payment was required to submit to Nicol important documents or their bank account information so that they could be paid their dividends. “If you are not paid you are required to submit documents that show your ownership of shares and your bank account information before September 30, this year, and a dividend form is available at our website,” the statement said. It said the company was introduced in 2001 by few shareholders who contributed their money to enable citizens to own the economy. Since its introduction, Nicol did not manage to provide dividends to its shareholders until complaints from them which led to the election in 2012 whereby Dr Gideon Kaunda emerged the new Nicol Board Chairman.
