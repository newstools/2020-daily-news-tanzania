WOMEN in Njombe Region have been urged to abide to dietary guidelines from health experts, which are necessary in raising their children to good physical and mental health state. Nutrition plays a crucial role in children development since deficiencies in essential nutrients may lead to malnutrition, thus affecting children’s mental and physical state. The coordinator of mother and child in Wanging’ombe District, Edshan Mtega made the remarks in an event organized by USAID TULONGE AFYA through Naweza platform in collaboration with the district’s health team. Speaking at the event dubbed ‘Mothers Meet Up Events’ over the weekend, she said that raising children properly for those at the age below six months was important in keeping good health throughout their life span. Ms Mtega said the event was an important platform to remind parents on their role of raising their children from zero age to five years, including breastfeeding without supplementing with food. She said when the mother notices some unusual and dangerous signs in the child, they must immediately take the child to the nearest medical facility for medical checkup. On his part, the USAID Tulonge Afya official from Njombe region, Edgar Mwakisu said Naweza platform gives priority to the health of the mother and child, starting from pregnancy to parenting the child. The organizers of the event used the occasion to remind parents on the need to sleep under treated mosquito nets every night, including children under five. They urged women to seek and receive prompt and appropriate care at first sign of new-born and childhood illness.
