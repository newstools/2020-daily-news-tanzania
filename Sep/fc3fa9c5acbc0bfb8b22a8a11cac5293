THE National Ranching Company Limited (NARCO) has embarked on a vital exercise that would demarcate and build fence in all its ranching blocks countrywide. The Acting Director General for NARCO, Masele Mipawa, told the ‘ Daily News’ in an interview that the exercise was aimed at curbing trespassing and illegal activities in their yards. He further said they found it important to place permanent boundaries around all their ranching blocks to boost security, and in turn attract more investments. “Usually, investors want to invest in an area with assured security and safety. So, we’re doing this, first for the security of the animals and their welfare, but also to attract more investors to come and invest in their midst,” he pointed out. Equally, Mr Mipawa said that according to their scheduled time frame, at least by the end of October this year, all their blocks countrywide would have officially marked boundaries. He further said they would also implement an exercise that would set aside special grazing blocks and thereafter lease them to livestock keepers at a fee. “The aim is to overcome and remove all land conflicts, often brewing due to few grazing areas being competed for,” he informed. In his remarks during the climax of this years’ Nanenane farmers exhibitions, Prime Minister Kassim Majaliwa said the fifth phase government, through NARCO would put up enough grazing areas in all districts within the country. Reinforcing that Mr Mipawa said at least two potential investors from Egypt and Namibia have shown interest and already lodged applications to invest in meat processing industries in their blocks. So far, at least 120 big and 200 small scale investors are currently running the blocks with different contracts countrywide. With at least 14 well established ranches scattered in different regions, NARCO still has a key role in producing improved livestock products.
