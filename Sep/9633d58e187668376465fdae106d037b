UNDER The Same Sun (UTSS), a non-governmental organisation supporting people with albinism yesterday donated 18 laptops to students with albinism in an endeavour to support them in their higher education pursuit. The initiative championed under the Vivian Grace Ash project also provides a 25 days pre-college training to equip them with skills on how to cope with university life and career guidance. UTSS Learning and Career Advancement Manager, Ms Grace Wabani, said that the training involves students from different levels of education and from various regions, adding that since the programme started in 2018, more than 91 students have benefited. “This is the fifth phase of such training, where it has cost more than 80m/-. The aim of this training, among other things, is to give young people the opportunity to identify a higher education system that requires the student to be independent and to make the right decisions in order to achieve their goals,” she explained. Moreover, she said they also train the students on financial and time management, efficient use of social media and how to organise their day including the need for breaks and leisure. UTSS has in the past 12 years sponsored more than 429 students with albinism in Tanzania from different levels of education. Ms Wabani called on various stakeholders in education and disability issues to continue prioritising and identify the inclusive agenda from community level. A beneficiary from Mwanza, Amina Bakari said the training has provided them with better ways to socialise as well as how to cope with campus life. “I would like to extend my gratitude to UTSS, because not many students can get this opportunity, it feels good to be provided with a laptop, which is an essential tool that will assist us in our daily life at the university,” she commented. One of the objectives of the organisation is to fight for rights and wellbeing of persons with albinism in the country through education and advocacy.
