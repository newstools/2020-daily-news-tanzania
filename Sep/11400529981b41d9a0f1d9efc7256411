SINGIDA District Commissioner (DC) Paskasi Muragili has urged entrepreneurs in the region to maintain discipline in spending the money they earn to expand their business capital and become economically strong. He made the call during the closing of entrepreneurs’ training attended by 68 participants from various parts of the region held at the Small Industries Development Organisation (SIDO). The DC said basically most of the entrepreneurs earned incomes in their various daily undertakings, but due to lack of discipline in spending money and lack of business plans, they normally found themselves insolvent whenever they needed it for other development issues. "Definitely, lack of business education is the reason behind your failure to keep proper records of your daily incomes and expenditure. Here, you have been taught business management.  “Utilise the knowledge you gained so that you can distinguish yourself from those who have not received this education," he said. Earlier, SIDO Regional Manager Agnes Yesaya said 68 participants had an opportunity to learn the skills of repairing and reinforcing their sewing machines as well as basic knowledge on business education. She called on participants to be catalysts of development in their workplace. Mr Dickson Shenkalwa, who facilitated the entrepreneurs in the repairs and reinforcement of sewing machines during training noted that many of the tailors did not have the skills of doing minor repairs of their working tools. “That resulted in incurring unnecessary expenses to hire half cooked artisans who actually failed to do maintenance fully…These participants will no longer face such challenges," he said.
