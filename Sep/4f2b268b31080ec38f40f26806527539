COMMISSIONER General of Drug Enforcement and Control Authority (DCEA) James Kaji has said Tanzania has registered roaring success in the fight against illegal drug use. He said from 2017 to date the war on illegal drug use has registered more than 90 per cent success, adding that the number of drug addicts undergoing treatment and rehabilitation has reached 8,200. The DCEA boss added that treatment and rehabilitation programmes and centres were directed towards elimination of drug abuse in the country. He said out of the 8,200 drug addicts undergoing methadone treatment, 35 of them were women at some sober house rehabilitation centres. Mr Kaji made the revelation in Dar es Salaam, while DCEA was receiving a donation of health equipment to support hospitals and sober houses against infectious diseases and sanitary towels for addicted women. “Currently there are nine centres offering methadone treatment and 29 registered sober house centres, which are rehabilitating the addicts. Three of the sober houses are specialised in accommodating and rehabilitating women addicts,” he pointed out. The donation received included 12 hand washing machines donated by the European Union Action against Drugs and organised Crime Organisation (EU-ACT), sanitisers and liquid soap, which are part of preventive measures against Covid-19. The commissioner general said the sanitary towels would serve at least 35 addicted women for one year. They were donated by a Tanzanian model and Miss Universe Tanzania 2007 Flaviana Matata through her Flaviana Foundation. Meanwhile, the commissioner general said involving every member of society in the fight against illegal drug use was the secret behind a drop in the number of street addicts. He also mentioned another factor as the arrest of drug traffickers and the speeding up of case hearing and determination.
