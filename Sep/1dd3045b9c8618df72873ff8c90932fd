FIRST Division League (FDL) side AFC Arusha will face Mainland Premier League side Polisi Tanzania in a friendly match at Sheikh Amri Abeid Kaluta Stadium in Arusha today. AFC which now operates under new management and patronage of the Arusha Regional Commissioner, Idd Kimanta, will use the match to sharpen its players’ skills in preparation for the FDL kick off. “We are grilling the AFC team so that our players can be fully prepared to tackle other teams in the forthcoming First Division League,” said the Acting team Secretary Bertha Ismail, adding that their mission is to play in the Mainland Premier League come 2021.
