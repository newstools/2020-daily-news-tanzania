THE Isles Basketball Premier League match between African Magic and Clickers was forced to end prematurely at Mao Zedong court due to darkness. The teams were tied on 76 -76 when the game was stopped five minutes to the stoppage time. The organisers here said it was very difficult to give the teams a five-minute extra time because the visibility was poor due to darkness. Still it was one of the most thrilling games of the league as both teams played well in all four quarters of the duel.

They began their onslaught with 110-61 victory over California before losing to Stone Town 101-68. They looked favourites to win their third match against African Magic.
