Serengeti Breweries Limited (SBL) has said sound market performance policy is an important strategy in nurturing and developing budding talents in the brewing industry. SBL Human Resources Director Conrad Msoma said in Dar es Salaam at the weekend that fairness, work ethic, values, attitude and a culture of inclusivity were some of the attributes that made SBL stand out from the crowd of others in the labour market. The brewer’s policy, he noted, was complementary to the company’s management system which was in line with requisite global systems. “SBL is the best place to work in because we endeavour to make employees happy. To be an employer of choice does not only entail good policies, but it also encompasses best practices demonstrated by an ingrained sound management culture,” he said. He said the beer-maker’s corporate culture was built around attitude and engagement, adding that employees with positive attitude usually grew to be great leaders with an eye for inculcating innovation and inclusivity and cutting waste that ensured that everyone had a positive role to play and felt to be a part of a larger team. Mr Msoma noted that the brewer had won praise in various categories that ranged from learning and staff development such as pioneering an e-learning platform that encompassed collaborative learning and information technology and staff recognition that had seen some of the brewer’s employees receive recognition awards for outstanding performance locally and abroad. Wading into the issue of the novel virus and the steps SBL had been taking to protect the employees against the disease, the HR director said the brewer had set highest health standards to ensure the safety of its staff, while observing all the WHO laid-down health protocols.
