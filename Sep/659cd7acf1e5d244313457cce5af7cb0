HELPING Hand for Relief and Development has supported Zanzibar Police College’s driving school with 350 chairs and 70 tables to boost training. Acting Zanzibar Police Commissioner, Senior Assistant Commissioner of Police (SACP) Saleh Mohamed received the over 200m/- worth of items, here recently, saying the support has come at an opportune time. He pleaded for more support from law enforcement stakeholders, arguing that the force needs computers, printers and repairs of its female soldiers’ dormitory to create a conducive learning environment for the men and women in uniforms as well as civilians. “This driving school is not exclusive for the police officers alone, we are training civilians as well,” SACP Mohamed said at a brief handover ceremony at Ziwani-based college, adding: “unfortunately, our infrastructures are not in good shape.” Helping Hand’s Country Representative, Mr Hassan Kimbwembwe said his organisation will continue working with the needy and pledged for sustained collaboration with the law enforcers. Responding, SACP Mohamed reaffirmed the force’s cooperation, saying the first of the over 3 00 Police General Orders (PGOs) advocates collaboration with members of the community. “The success of the police force relies on cordial relations with members of the public,” said the acting Zanzibar police chief. The College Acting Principal Assistant Commissioner of Police Hasina Ramadhan Taufiq appreciated the support, describing it as “A morale booster to our work.”
