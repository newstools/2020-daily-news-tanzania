A VILLAGER of Songambele in Biharamulo District in Kagera Region, Kakila John (35), has been sentenced to death by hanging after he was convicted of murder. State Attorney Haruna Shabani told the High Court during hearing of a murder case that the offence was committed on November 2, 2015. He told the court that on that fateful date, at about 8.00pm, Ms Tatu Charles (45) was preparing dinner in the kitchen when she was attacked by the machete-wielding man, killing her on the spot. He further told the court that before the incident, the accused suspected the woman of being a witch. Before delivering the judgement, Judge Lucia Kairo said four witnesses, who testified for the prosecution, including the daughter of the victim, were credible and reliable. Judge Kairo also noted that visual identification by one of the witnesses and a report filed at Nemba Police Post immediately after the incident added weight to the prosecution case. “The prosecution proved the murder case beyond a reasonable doubt and the evidence clearly showed that there was no other killer, but the accused,” she said. Meanwhile, a teacher from Kayanga Secondary School in Karagwe District identified as Ms Florentina Ignace (41) died after a motorcycle she was aboard collided with another one. Kagera Regional Police Commander (RPC) Revocatus Malimi said the accident occurred on Friday afternoon at Kayanga Village. He said Ms Ignace was a passenger on a motorbike, heading home after classes. He said the rider swayed and rammed into another motorcycle coming from the opposite direction. "Apparently, the impact was very big, causing serious injuries to Ms Ignace who died as she was rushed to Nyakahanga Designated Hospital (DDH)," he said. The RPC said two persons had been held in connection with the accident as investigations were in progress. He named them as Jovin John (39) and Germanus Gaspar (34).
