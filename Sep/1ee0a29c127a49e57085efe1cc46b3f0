CCM parliamentary candidate for Nkenge constituency in Missenyi district, Mr Florent  Kyombo  has appealed to Tanzanians  to elect leaders, who preach development, and set aside tribal, religious and political ideologies in their campaigns. He made the appeal during a campaign rally held at Buyango village in Missenyi district on Sunday. He said that once voted on October 28th this year, his priorities would include construction of a District Hospital, improving the area education sector and installing reliable electricity in villages. Elaborating, he said all his development plans are contained in CCM manifesto, adding that the fifth phase government successfully fulfilled them in the past five years, by seeing into it that tax payers' money was properly utilized. “President John Magufuli accomplished a lot in his first five years, so he deserves to be given an additional and final term," he said. Mr Kyombo   listed some of the  major projects implemented  in the past five years (2015-2020) as the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) that would revolutionize the people's lives on economic and social fronts. His list also included the Julius Nyerere Hydropower project that is envisioned to generate 2,115MW upon its completion and the New MV Victoria Hapa Kazi Tu steamer. During the 2015-2020, eight out of nine constituencies in Kagera region were led by CCM Legislators and hence, listed as Bukoba Rural (Jasson Rweikiza), Muleba South (Professor Anna Tibaijuka), Muleba North (Charles Mwijage), Missenyi-Nkenge (Dr Diodorus Kamala).
