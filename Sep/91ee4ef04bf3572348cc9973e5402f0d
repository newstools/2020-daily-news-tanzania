The Advocates Disciplinary Committee has ordered the name of Fatma Karume to be permanently removed from the roll of advocates and member of the Tanganyika Law Society (TLS) for professional misconduct. Such decision was reached today (September 23, 2020) by the Committee at its meeting held at the High Court in Dar es Salaam and found the seasoned lawyer guilty of going against the advocates ethics. It is like misery over misery as the unexpected decision come just a day after IMMMA Advocates where she was working with announced to end their partnership in the law firm she served for years. In September last year Principal Judge Dr Eliezer Feleshi suspended Ms Karume temporarily from practising for allegedly issuing unprofessional and disrespectful submissions in court proceedings involving President Dr John Magufuli and Attorney General Dr Adelardus Kilangi.
