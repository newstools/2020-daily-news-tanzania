DODOMA City Council director, Joseph Mafuru has warned negligent workers that he will not hesitate to take stern disciplinary actions against them. He raised a red flag during his maiden meeting with employees of the city council after he was appointed by President John Magufuli. Mr Mafuru, who used the meeting to introduce himself, said it was important that all employees use their time and dedicate their professional service to their employer. “My friends, time management is very important, therefore I want to tell you that I will not tolerate any head of department, who will fail to discharge his/her duties, also it is important for all employees to observe punctuality at work,’’ he said adding that he would not tolerate any kind of negligence. Mr Mafuru further said: “When you leave the office after working hours make sure that you have accomplished all your duties, and get back to your home chores, and the next day come fresh and perform other duties.” However, he asked them to perform their duties professionally and observe efficiency and ethics and as well directly attend to the public in the field instead of only sitting in the offices to wait for them. “You need to work professionally and above all we should not sit down in our offices to wait for complaints from people, instead, we should put plans in place to follow them and work on their problems,” pointed out the director. He further underscored the need for joint collaborative efforts in the course of discharging their duties. “We are all in one family of Dodoma City Council, therefore I want you to work together so as to achieve on attaining our targets,’’ he added.
