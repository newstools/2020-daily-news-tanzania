Equity for Tanzania (EFTA), a financial and equipment loans providing firm, has provided entrepreneurship and financial management training to Mount Kilimanjaro porters. The training aimed at developing financial management skills which would enable porters to improve their businesses and manage their financials during low tourism season or when disasters hit the sector. The EFTA Marketing and Business Development Manager, Peter Temu said the training came after some of the sector workers and majority of the porters faced hardships financially when the Covid-19 pandemic hit the world and during tourism low seasons. “We understand that some porters find themselves in difficult times financially when the low tourism season commences and global disasters hit, such as Covid-19, which impacted many people’s lives worldwide,” Mr Temu said recently. The training, thus, would enable porters to expand their income portfolio by establishing new businesses, a move which will help them survive during the low tourism season or when disasters such as Covid-19 occur. During the pandemic, the firm said, some porters could not afford even one meal a day, simply because they depend on a single source of income. The training wants to impact some changes to them to prevent similar situations from befalling them again. “Apart from improving their well-being, we at EFTA also believe that this training will give (porters) education to expand the scope of their businesses,” Mr Temu said. The training facilitator, Mr Noel Katongo, advised the participants of the training to make sure they use the opportunity to improve their businesses as well as building good customer relationships. “To strengthen your businesses, what is needed here is to create good relationships with your potential clients; this would enable your businesses to grow, survive and become sustainable,” he noted.
