REGIONAL irrigation engineers have been instructed to speed up various programmes intended to increase irrigated areas from 694,715 hectares to one million hectares by 2025. The Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Agriculture, Gerald Kusaya issued the order while opening a twoday meeting for management and irrigation engineers from the National Irrigation Commission. Kusaya said it was high time all irrigation engineers in the country focus on putting in place effective plans so that the government desire is fulfilled. “The goal of the fifth phase government in the irrigation sector is to ensure that 1,000,000 hectares are being irrigated by 2025. We should ask ourselves, are we on track? Have we done enough?” queried Kusaya. In his opening remarks, the Secretary-General noted that the Ministry of Agriculture wants the Irrigation Commission to focus more on addressing infrastructure challenges so that farmers can produce more crops to enable the country have food security. He commended the Irrigation Commission for successfully expanding the area by constructing and rehabilitating a total of 179 irrigation schemes and thus successfully increasing the irrigated area from 461,000 hectares in 2015 to 694,715 hectares in 2020. The Secretary-General added that productivity has increased in irrigation schemes from an average of 1.8 - 2.0 tons per hectare to an average of 4.0 - 5.0 tons per hectare for rice, while maize crop production increased from 1.5 tons to 3.7- 5.0 tons per hectare.
