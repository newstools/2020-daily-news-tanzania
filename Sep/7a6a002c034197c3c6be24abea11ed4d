AGRICOM Africa, a local supplier of farming machines and machinery in implementing the Agricultural Sector Development Programme (ASDP II), is training Rukwa Region cooperative cadres in use of tractors to reduce farming costs. The long-term training programme was launched here by the region’s Assistant Regional Administrative Secretary, Mr Ocram Chengula. Mr Chengula welcomed the training programme, saying it sought to put to gainful use of 574,291 hectares available by villagers, the key members of the primary cooperatives and the basic target of the ASDP II. “We highly welcome this programme because most of our smallholder farmers use hoes or animal-drawn implements. This programme seeks to replace hand hoe to tractors to these farmers. Under this programme farmers would be guaranteed of local and export markets,” he said. Maize is the region’s dominant annual crop, followed by paddy, finger millet, sorghum, wheat and bulrush millet. Maize constitutes 73.6 per cent of total area planted with annual crops and tractors would increase maize and vegetable production in the region. Agricom Africa Acting General Manager Mr Remmy Nindi said the company believed Rukwa could produce more maize by using tractors because good arable soil was in hands of villagers who are members of cooperative societies. Tractors would be given to a cooperative society with 72 members and capable of paying for the tractors. Agricom has offices in Morogoro, Mbeya, Dodoma and Kahama towns. The ASPD II was launched in 2018.
