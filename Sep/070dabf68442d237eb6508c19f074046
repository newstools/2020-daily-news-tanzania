JKT HQ and the national team boxer, Boniface Mlingwa yesterday set a new bar in the ongoing National Boxing Championship as he matched to the finals in just 23 seconds by knocking out Emmanuel Marwa for Ruvu at River Nile hall in Babati, Manyara. It was by the refereeâ€™s decision to end the bout, witnessing Marwa receiving heavy blows from his opponent. It was indeed the hardest time for him as each punch he received had no mercy but was ruthless. Mlingwa will then face Ezra Paul of Ngome in the bantamweight final. Paul got his ticket to the finals, after he beat Hamad Furahisha of Tanzanite Manyara in a thrilling bout. This bout brought together experienced boxers who previously participated in the 2014 Commonwealth Competition in Glasgow, Scotland. Saidi Kanenda, a light weight boxer from Mbweni displayed an outstanding performance in his first and second rounds when he knocked out Mussa Omari of Band Coy in the second round.
