MZUMBE University has opened another campus in Tegeta suburb, Kinondoni. The campus, whose capacity is 1,500 students, starts with two undergraduate degree programmes - Public Administration and Accounting and Finance. Mzumbe University Vice-Chancellor, Prof Lughano Kusiluka, said they had spent two years to renovate buildings after the government handed over to the university Tegeta Secondary School buildings. “We started renovation work in 2018 and we spent about 800m/- on transforming the buildings into a university facility,” Prof Kusiluka said at the just ended 15th Universities’ Exhibition. The main Dar es Salaam Campus, which is situated in Upanga, Kinondoni, offers only Master’s. Gracing the exhibition, Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology, Dr Leonard Akwilapo, said the government recognised the importance of producing skilled graduates through higher learning institutions. “We keep on insisting universities to offer quality education and produce competent and creative graduates, with ability to create jobs that match with competitive national, regional and international markets,” he said. He added that the government had been creating an enabling learning environment by constructing and renovating classrooms, laboratories, dormitories, lecture halls and  administrative buildings at all levels of education. For instance, he said, for primary and ordinary level—Standard One to Form Four—the government had offered 1.03tri/- from 2016 to 2020 to facilitate free education for all. This initiative raised the number of primary school enrolment from 8.3 million in 2015 to 10.9 million this year. For secondary school education, enrolment rose from 1.6 million in 2015 to 2.2 million in 2019, while Form Five to Six enrolment rose from 126,024 in 2015 to 153,420 in 2019.
