MEDADI Chitezi (60), a resident from Ulumi A village in Kalambo District, Rukwa Region, has been sentenced to serve 30 years in jail after pleading guilty of raping a ten-year old girl. Before passing the sentence, the trial magistrate, Mr Nixon Temu, told the court that Chitezi committed the felony against Section 130 (1)(2) and (e) and Section 131 (1) of Penal Code (Cap 16,R.E 2019). It was established that when the accused appeared before the court he pleaded not guilty of the crime but pleaded guilty after cross examination. The prosecution side led by Rajab Ndunda had proved the case beyond reasonable doubt that Ndunda committed the offence. “The crime committed by Chitezi is barbaric and inhumane. Although he pleaded guilty of the offence, a harsh sentence is necessary to serve as a lesson not only to the accused but also to others with such behaviour,” ruled the trial magistrate. Earlier, it was established in the court that Chitezi committed the crime on August 12, 2020 in Ulumi village in Kalambo District at night. Chitezi prayed for mercy, saying he felt remorse as he committed the crime while he was under strong influence of alcohol.
