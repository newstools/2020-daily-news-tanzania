Organised by the Future Stars Academy of Arusha, the Chipkizi Cup 2020 is scheduled to take place from December 8th to 13th , 2020 and will bring into Tanzania more than 150 teams from Kenya, Rwanda and as far as South Africa and the Democratic Republic of Congo. “Despite the current pandemic, we are still going ahead with preparations, hoping that the Covid-19 threat will be contained in a few months’ time,” said Alfred Itaeli, the Director of Future Stars Academy. Also to participate this year, are Youth Teams from Japan but this time again it will depend on how soon international flights resume globally. According to the organisers, registration and participating fees will be done online. Categories for the competition will include the ‘Under-7’, Under-9; Under-11; Under-13; Under- 15; Under 17 and Under-20 for both male and female teams. Kenya topped the last year’s Chipkizi Cup’s 10th Anniversary after winning in most categories of the 2019 season of East African Youth Football tournament, but Tanzania wasn’t far behind either. The neighbouring country won four trophies including those of Under-7, by Sakata Soccer; Under-9, by Express Soccer; Under-11 (Angaza Soka) and Soka Talents won the Under-13 categories of the East African soccer tourney staged for five days at the Tanganyika Game Trackers (TGT) grounds. But it was no surprise; Kenya had brought to Arusha 114 teams, while the host, Tanzania managed to field only 52. Azam FC of Dar es Salaam took the trophy for the Under-20, while the Saint Patrick School of Arusha won the Under-17 and Upendo Friends of Arusha took the Under-15 trophies. Tanzania managed to garner four trophies last year, including Under-20 (Azam), Under-17 (Saint Patrick); Under-15 (Upendo Friends) and for the girls, the Under-20 (Arusha Soccer Center) and Under-15 girls (Future Stars Academy)
