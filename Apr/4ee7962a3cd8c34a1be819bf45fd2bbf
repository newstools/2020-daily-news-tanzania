THREE people, including a businesswoman, appeared before the Kisutu Resident Magistrate’s Court in Dar es Salaam today (Thursday) charged with one count of trafficking in a substantial amount of Heroin Hydrochloride, which are narcotic drugs, weighing 2099.74 grams. They are Fatuma Mgwami (27), a businesswoman from Tandika Azimio, Omar Khamis (57) and Ahmed Said, alias Edi Kipande (57), both businessmen from Zanzibar. They were not allowed to enter a plea to the charge against them when they appeared before Senior Resident Magistrate Rashid Chaungu because they fall under the Economic and Organised Crime Control Act. The magistrate told the accused that his court lacked jurisdiction to entertain anything, including the issue of bail and that their case will be heard by the High Court’s Corruption and Economic Crime Division upon completion of investigations.
