THE Egypt Football Association (EFA) has proposed the reduction on the number of foreign players plying their trade in the first and second divisions. A move likely to affect East Africans as there are several serving the team at the moment. Tanzanian defensive midfielder Himid Mao Mkami, who also plays for the National team, Taifa Stars, is among the players playing in Egypt. In a statement, the Egypt FA proposes for a reduction of foreign players spots in the Egyptian Premier League with clubs only be allowed four (4) foreign players. This will be a reduction by one (1), going down from five (5). For the second division clubs, the clubs can only sign two (2) foreign players, whilst the third division clubs are not allowed to sign any foreign players. The proposals are debatable by the stake holders but will most likely be effected as the North African country restructures their respective leagues with a goal to produce more home talents. There are also Ugandans featuring in the Egypt top flight division as; Fast paced winger Abdul Lumala is at Pyramids, Emmanuel Arnold Okwi featuring at Al Ittihad Alexandria Club, Khalid Aucho (Misr Lel Makkasa SC), Allan Kyambadde (El Gouna) and Patrick Henry Kaddu (Ismaily Sporting Club). Mkami plays for ENPPI as a midfielder. Prior to joining the club, Shiza Kichuya played for the club on loan from Egyptian Second Division side Pharco FC. The Egypt Premier League is currently on a forced break because of the raging Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic world-wide.
