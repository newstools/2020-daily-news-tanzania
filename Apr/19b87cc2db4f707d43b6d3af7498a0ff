She stressed that the government had an obligation of ensuring that all health workers were safe and free from any risk when performing their duties. “I am asking you to convey my appreciations to all workers in the health sector for taking part in serving the victims of the Coronavirus which is a global pandemic,” she said. The minister also thanked the team for continued support to the government in its initiatives to curb the spread of Covid-19. For his part, the Chief Medical Officer, Prof Abel Makubi, said fighting Covid-19 entailed concerted efforts from government, stakeholders and the general public. He underscored the importance of protecting health workers from coronavirus infections, reminding owners of private hospitals to train their staff on how best to protect themselves when attending patients.
