ISLES Premier League giants, Jang’ombe Boys have opted to e-communication as system that enables players, technical bench and management to effectively communicate. Like other countries, all sports activities have been suspended in the Isles due to COVID-19 threat since they enable huge gathering of people. The team’s President, Ali Othman Kibichwa said here that e-communication system has been very effective as it has helped players to work as team similarly to the situation prior to the Premier League suspension. He named the e-communication system now being widely applied as Facebook, WhatsApp and e-mail addresses. “We are still together as a team and all what the club intends to tell players and officials are delivered through the addresses,” said Kibichwa. Adding he said, as they strictly observes government and health experts’ directives, staying at home has been among the safety methods recommended  against spread of Covid-19. “You won’t know who is affected and who is not, hence our players have to remain at their homes until further notice,” he said. Jangombe Boys are among the Isles Premier League title contenders despite being not very far from the danger zone. The Unguja-based club is placed 11th in the 16-team league after collecting 25 points. KMKM, who were still ahead of the rest prior to hiatus, are being closely challenged by JKU, KVZ, Zimamoto and Mlandege.
