UNGUJA South Regional Commissioner (RC) Ayoub Mohamed Mahmoud is drumming up for the ‘U-Report Tanzania’, a project that would be effective in reducing unemployment challenges amongst the youth. “As RC, I am duty-bound to encourage young people to register for ‘U-Report.’ It may be helpful to you,” Mahmoud says. U-Report is a social messaging tool and data collection system developed by UNICEF to improve citizen engagement, inform leaders, and foster positive change. The programme sends SMS polls and alerts to its participants, collecting real-time responses, and subsequently publishes gathered data. Issues polled include health, education, water, sanitation and hygiene, youth unemployment, HIV/AIDS, disease outbreaks, Human/Child rights, WASH, menstrual hygiene and anything else people want to discuss. “Our country has one of the fastest growing adolescent and youth populations; therefore it is vital to take the voices of young people seriously. I urge the youth to register by texting and sending the key word “SAJILI” to the short code 15070. It is entirely free to join!” Since U-Report was launched in the Mainland in 2017, more than 173,000 subscribers, mainly the youth, joined before it was extended to Zanzibar, where new U-Reporters are being encouraged to join, in order to share their voices.
