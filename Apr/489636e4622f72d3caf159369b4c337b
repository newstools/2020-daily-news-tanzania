THE newly appointed Permanent Secretary (PS) in the Ministry of Works, Transport and Communication, Dr Zainab Chaula has urged the public to use information and communication technology (ICT) to address challenges facing them, and in turn boost the economy. She said ICT application is a vital tool that requires recognition, adding: “We should invest in ICT and use it as an opportunity. Personally, I have used it in health sector and President’s Office for Regional Administration and Local Government.” Dr Chaula was formerly at the Ministry of Health, Community Development, Gender, Elderly and Children, but in a recent mini-reshuffle carried out by Head of the State, Dr John Magufuli she was moved to replace, Dr Maria Sasabo who has retired. Commenting, the outgoing Dr Sasabo, who was the ministry’s Permanent Secretary, said communication, is a cross cutting sector that boosts implementation of projects and strategy in all ministries, sectors and subsectors. “Both private and public sectors depend on ICT in implementing day to day duties. Already there are policies, guidelines and regulations that govern the sector,” she pointed out. On his part, Minister for Works, Transport and Communication, Engineer Isack K amwele, directed the new PS using ICT to ensure that national postal policy serves the people and brings changes in public. “The national policy should change the way of postal operations based on ICT applications in parcels transportation,” said the Minister. Commenting, Deputy Minister for Works, Transport and Communication, Engineer Atashasta Nditiye, noted that the communication sector was still a drive in the country’s economic development. “We work in teamwork to open doors for the public. We work for the people and it is among the best five sectors, which support economic growth,” said Engineer Nditiye, while reminding his staff to adhere to measures announced by the Health Ministry on how to stop coronavirus infections and spread.
