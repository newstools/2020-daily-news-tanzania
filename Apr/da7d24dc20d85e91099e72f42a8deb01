CHINESE doctorate student of the University of Dar es Salaam (UDSM) Guagiong Li has appealed for unity among all people in the world against the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic. Speaking in Dar es Salaam, Mis Li, who has stayed in Tanzania for at least three years, said there was every reason for unity instead of discriminating against each other basing on racism or nationality, particularly this time when every nation was struggling to fight against the deadly disease. She noted that even incidents of discrimination against African nationals in Guanghzou province in China as reported in some media was done by groups of some Chinese people, but was not a stance of China as a nation. "I am glad that the Chinese government swiftly took action to control the situation which was inhuman. China has been in good friendship with Africa for many years, thus it is impossible for it to remain silent and not take action against the wrongdoers," she said. She argued that the governmentâ€™s decision to act against individuals who discriminated against those of origin showed how it cared about humanity and cooperation with African countries. She said she did not see any reason from those Chinese individuals to discriminate against people with African origin. Mis Li said there were many Chinese people who were conducting their activities in Africa without facing any discrimination as far as the coronavirus was concerned. She called upon people in all nations to refrain from discrimination and instead continue cooperating in finding effective ways of combating the disease which since its outbreak last year had already claimed lives of thousands of people globally. Meanwhile, Mis Li admitted that she was feeling proud and she had peace of mind to study in Tanzania and her fellow Tanzanian students had been treating her well and was feeling one of them.
