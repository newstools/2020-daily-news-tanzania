Libya’s former interim Prime Minister Mahmoud Jebril has died from the coronavirus, according to his political party. The 67-year-old contracted the virus in Egypt in late March and died at a hospital in Cairo, according to his aide. He was in power as head of the National Transitional Council during months of civil war in 2011 which led to the ousting of former long-time ruler Colonel Muammar Gaddafi. Libya’s internationally recognised government in Tripoli offered its condolences in a statement that described Mr Jebril as a “national figure”. Reputed to be an astute technocrat by those who knew him and worked with him, he was Libya’s transitional prime minister for just seven months, and later formed his own political bloc known as the National Forces' Alliance. As a politician, Mr Jebril was seen by his supporters as a potential force for transforming the country.
