THE Tarime District Commissioner (DC), Engineer Msafiri Mtemi has ordered the closure of a gold mine in Nyamongo town immediately after 34 cows and one sheep died after drinking poisonous water from the mine. The district commissioner also instructed the owner of the mine, Boniphace Alex to make appropriate corrections to the sewerage system to prevent flow of the water into water sources to avoid further harm. Speaking in the area after chairing the safety committee meeting to evaluate the effects of mining operations, he said ordinary citizens were directed to avoid using any contaminated water or to feed their livestock around the area until environmentalists assured of safety. In another step, Mr Msafiri instructed experts from the National Environment Management Council (NEMC) to collaborate with the regional mineral office to conduct inspection of all small mines in the district as well as mining facilities to ensure that they comply with environmental regulations. ''I am ordering environmentalists from NEMC and the regional mining office to conduct an inspection at all the centers and small mines in the district here to ensure that they comply with environmental conservation rules or regulations, otherwise they will be closed, especially during this period where heavy rains continue in this region,” he said. According to Tarime District Livestock Officer, Dr Peter Nyanje, all 34 cows and one sheep were severely affected after drinking water contaminated with toxic chemicals. He said 10 other cows and four sheep affected in the tragedy were being treated while he ordered the carcasses of the dead animals to be buried immediately to avoid further harm to residents around the area. ''The livestock department ordered all the dead cows and sheep to be buried before greedy people decide to sell the meat to the public, which could be catastrophic,” said Dr Nyanje.
