WATER sources in Munanila and Mkatanga wards in Buhingwe have run dry and the government is conducting a feasibility study to identify new sources that could supply sufficient water. Minister for Water, Prof Makame Mbarawa told the National Assembly here on Tuesday that the initial study was conducted and revealed that neither the water sources nor the infrastructure would be effective for the growing water demand in those areas. The minister said the government has been working with the Belgium counterpart to examine the water infrastructure and sources in Munanila, Mwayaya and Mkatanga with the view of expanding and renovating the distribution network. “Belgium has expressed commitment to fund the process, unfortunately, following the study the cost to rehabilitate the water plants was higher than the allocated budget,” he said. “The study also revealed that the water sources in Munila and Mkatanga had dried off,” he added. Apparently, the government’s study found another source in Mwayaya which if developed could only feed the water demand for Mwayaya ward residents. According to Prof Mbarawa, the feasibility study started in November 2017 and was expected to be followed with immediate construction of the water plant. He said authorities are now working on examining the water source in Mwayaya in which the activity would be completed in May 2020. “Shortly after the assessment, the state will announce procedures to acquire a contractor to implement the project,” he said. Prof Mbarawa was responding to a question posed by Buhigwe lawmaker, Mr Albert Obama Ntabaliba (CCM). The legislator claimed that a water project in Mnanila, Mwayaya and Mkatanga, Buhigwe—Kibande Kasumo, Mugera/Migongo had not been implemented. He demanded an explanation as to when the project will be executed. The MP also wanted to know whether the government had so far identified the contractor to implement the project.
