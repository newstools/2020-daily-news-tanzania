IN a bid to ensure the supply of clean water, the government, through the Ministry of Water, has succeeded to expand the water network in Bukoba municipality by 95 per cent. In 2016, the government finalized a big water project in the municipality and later released funds for expansion of a water network in the area. The released fund was spent on the expansion of the water network in Kibeta, Kagondo and Ijuganyondo wards and some parts of Kahororo, Kashai, Nshambya and Nyanga wards. Minister for Water, Prof. Makame Mbarawa, told the parliament on Friday that the expansion of water network has helped to improve water services in the area. He said the government is looking for funds to connect water to Kanyangereko, Maruku and Karabagaine. The minister was responding to Bukoba rural MP Jasson Rweikiza (CCM) who wanted to know when the government would release funds for supplying water to Maruku, Kanyangereko, Karabagaine, Katoma and Nyakato. He said the government had already promised that Bukoba water Supply and Sanitation Authority (BUWASA) would connect all nearby wards to the water network. The minister added that the Rural Water Sanitation Authority (RUWASA) has already conducted a feasibility study on Kyeiringisa River so that its water could be supplied to Nyakato and Katoma wards.
