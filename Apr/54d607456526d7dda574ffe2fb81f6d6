THE government here yesterday insisted that it was in talks with investors to start Mchuchuma and Liganga projects after the amendment of the natural wealth and resources laws, the House was told here yesterday. This was said by the Ministry of Trade and Industries in a written response to a question asked by the Ludewa MP, Deogratius Francis (CCM) who had wanted to know when the projects would commence. The ministry said the government is reviewing the contracts for the Mchuchuma and Liganga projects to align with the amended natural wealth and resources laws. In the process, all strategic projects in the extractive sector including those in the mining, gas and oil are undergoing reviews. The Liganga iron ore mine and iron steel complex, according to the statement is expected to produce one metric tonne of the products, vanadium pentoxide and titanium dioxide per year. The Mchuchuma proects include the construction of a 600 MW coal-fired power station, of which 250 MW will be used by the iron plant, while the remaining 350 MW will feed the national grid. “The Mchuchuma and Liganga projects in Ludewa district, Njombe region are aimed at producing iron and coal” further read the statement. The minister in the statement said the projects require a lot of money despite having signed a contract with the investor. It also needs modern technology in efforts to compete in the global market. However, according the government the project has been delayed by lack of capital and technology to drill iron ore.
