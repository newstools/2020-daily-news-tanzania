Speaking to the ‘Daily News’ here yesterday, Kapalata said he is ready to feature for any side among the Premier League sides, adding he is not ready to continue serving his current team. Kapalata has already played for  several Premier Leagues teams. Among the teams are Tanzania Prisons, Njombe Mji and Mwadui FC. He said he has signed a one-year deal with KMC. Adding, the former Mwadui  player said he has received some offers from Premier League teams, but he will conduct  talks with his current team to see if they still  want him to stay or not. KMC, who are struggling to avoid relegation, have played twenty nine games and they have won nine, lost fourteen and drawn in six others. KMC are placed at the 14th position until the time when the Premier League was suspended. They have pocketed 33 points from the 28-game outings. They have netted 26 goals and conceded 33 goals.
