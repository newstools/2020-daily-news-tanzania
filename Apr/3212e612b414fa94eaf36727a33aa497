Speaking with ‘Sunday News’ yesterday, Lukinda said they will put more efforts in training and work hard to win their nine remaining matches. The former Mashujaa FC player said the team’s camp has been disbanded due to coronavirus outbreak that led to the suspension of all sporting activities in the country. At CCM Kirumba Stadium, they will play six consecutive matches against Ndanda FC, Namungo FC, Coastal Union, Police Tanzania, Mtibwa Sugar and Lipuli FC while away matches will be against JKT Tanzania at Jamuhuri Stadium in Dodoma, Azam FC and Simba SC at Uhuru Stadium in Dar es Salaam.
