DAR ES SALAAM Institute of Technology (DIT), seeks to partner with Bora Shoe Company Limited for practical skills development. The joint venture, set to be signed in the near future following completion of necessary procedures, is also intended to enable the DIT offer experts to work for the shoe industry. The management of the institute recently visited the Bora Shoe Company Limited to set stage for the envisaged cooperation. Team of leaders from the DIT, led by the Principal Prof Preksedis Ndomba, among other things, went to learn about activities undertaken at the industry. Prof Ndomba explained that DIT Mwanza campus, which offers courses of animal skins processing and shoe making, would largely benefit from the partnership by increasing skills as well as offer expertise to the industry. The students would also have opportunity to get practical trainings at the industry, whereas the industry will be getting experts from the institute. Prof Ndomba yesterday expressed hopes over the new partnership and thanked the industry for its readiness to start the cooperation which would bear fruits for both parts. "We have seen manufacturing of shoes from initial stage of processing skin to final product, we are optimistic that this partnership will be of great benefits," he stated. Managing Director of the Bora Shoe Company Ltd, Mr Rajesh Sajinan, promised to strengthen partnership with the DIT in order to get specialized experts from the institute. "The cooperation will enable our industry to work with specialized experts of engineering technologies such as electrical and mechanical because our industry has machines of different technologies," he said.
