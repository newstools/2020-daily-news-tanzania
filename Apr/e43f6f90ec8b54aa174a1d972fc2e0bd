BY taking social distancing into consideration, people here have planted trees in different areas of Unguja and Pemba in implementation of the national tree planting week which normally starts on April 13. The Deputy Minister for Agriculture, Natural Resources, Livestock and Fisheries, Dr Makame Ali Ussi said here that since mass tree planting was not possible due to Coronavirus (COVID-19), which restricts gatherings, the only solution was to plant trees ‘individually’ in villages under the supervision of local leaders. According to the Minister, the plan was to plant 1,153,000 tree seedlings this year (2020/2021), up from 1,222,000 tree seedlings planted last year (2019/2020), which include fruit and clove trees. “Let us utilize the available rains to plant trees because we need the trees to replace the ones that are cut down for construction purposes, and those used as source of energy (firewood), and cleared to find land for farming or house construction and sand quarrying,” he said. Dr Ussi said that this year’s theme for tree planting is “Plant and nurture the trees for economy prosperity and environmental conservation,” and that the plan was to plant 250,000 tree seedling in public  land; 606,000 tree seedling in private areas and 5,000 tree seedlings along roads. Ms Khadija Mohamed from the Department of Forestry and Non-Renewable Natural Resources (DFNR)- Zanzibar said there were enough seedlings for many types of plants, including the Isles main cash crop of cloves ready to be distributed for planting.
