ALREADY impacted by COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic members of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) are asking the government for tax relief and exemption. Fish mongers, and other traders in markets and shops in different parts of the Zanzibar city say there has been drastic reduction of customers since the government imposed partial business ‘lockdown’ in efforts to control the spread of the virus. “We are really desperate. It is a global problem, but let the government allow tax exemption at least for three months as the world battles COVID-19,” Mr Omar Ibrahim a trader in Darajani market said. While the authorities from the Zanzibar Revenue Board (ZRB), digest the request, the management of the Kinyasini Market in north Unguja has swiftly reacted by promising tax relief as soon as possible. Traders pay different amount of tax on daily basis, monthly and yearly depending on the size of the business and Ms Mwaka Hassan running a retail shop said tax relief or exemption at this time is crucial. “We will definitely consider traders’ request for tax relief so that we have revenue to collect as they also sale at this time of challenges caused by coronavirus,” Mr Mbarouk Maalim Mohamed assistant manager of Kinyasini Market said. He said Hotels are closed and local customers have decreased due to the virus, “Therefore we have to find ways of copying with the situation and we increase awareness campaign so that more do not contract the disease. Everyone should promote observing health precautions which include self isolations, social distancing, and frequent hand washing.”
