FORMER Simba striker Emmanuel Okwi could be facing stiff challenge to remain in Egypt after the Egypt Football Association (EFA) has proposed the reduction on the number of foreign players plying their trade in the first and second divisions. In a statement, the Egypt FA proposes for a reduction of foreign players spots in the Egyptian Premier League with clubs only be allowed four (4) foreign players. This will be a reduction by one (1), going down from five (5). For the second division clubs, the clubs can only sign two (2) foreign players, whilst the third division clubs are not allowed to sign any foreign players. The proposals are debatable by the stake holders but will most likely be effected as the North African country restructures their respective leagues with a goal to produce more home talent. This means, Ugandan striker Okwi will be required to fire from all cylinders to keep his place at his current club-- Al Ittihad Alexandria Club. At the moment the Alexandria based club has four foreign players—centre back Wilson Akakpo from Ghana, attackers Razack Cisse from Ivory Coast, Okwi from Uganda and Mohamed Anis Saltou from Libya. Okwi joined the Egyptian club from Simba at the close of 2018/2019 season as a free agent for a fee of €250k. He has so far scored two goals and provided one assist this season. His challenger for the starting lineup Cisse has scored two goals and provided three assists. The Egypt Premier League is currently on a forced break because of the raging Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic world-wide. This move is likely to affect several other East Africans playing in Egypt. Tanzanian defensive midfielder Himid Mao, who also plays for the National team, Taifa Stars, is among the players playing in Egypt Mkami plays for ENPPI as a midfielder. Prior to joining the club, Shiza Kichuya played for the club on loan from Egyptian Second Division side Pharco FC.
