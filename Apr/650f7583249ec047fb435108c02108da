SPECIAL Seats Member of Parliament Dr Jasmine Bunga has urged the government to tap water from Mgeta River in Mvomero District as a way of addressing water woes in Morogoro municipality. The MP alleged that for years the state had been depending on its water supply from Mindu dam but the dam has been drying off during the dry season thus leaving hundreds of residents without the precious liquid. “The government must think of sourcing water from the Mgeta River. The water plant can only pump water when the water levels are within the required standard in which such a shortage affects water supply to Morogoro Municipal,” she noted. According to the lawmaker, the River could offer a lasting solution to water chaos in the municipality. Responding, Water Minister Prof Makame Mbarawa explained that water shortage in the rivers emptying their waters into the Mindu dam has been greatly caused by the climatic change. Nevertheless, human activities near the water sources especially in the Uluguru Mountains are to blame, he said. “We need a collective approach to address these challenges,” said the minister, noting, the government has thus tasked the Morogoro water supply and sewerage authority to seek a consultant who would survey new and alternative water sources that would help improve water supply in Morogoro municipality. The plans announced by the minister include updating the regional water master plan. French Development Agency (AFD), has already expressed interest to finance the project, which is set to kick off during the coming financial year. Prof Mbarawa told MPs that a memorandum of understanding between the government and AFD will be signed at the end of the 2019/20 financial year. He insisted that upon the completion of the regional water master plan, Morogoro Municipal will be able to identify and develop other water sources that would help to end the water crisis.
