THE government says the ongoing construction of Kilwa Road will be completed on time in a bid to reduce perennial traffic gridlock to road users. Deputy Minister for Works, Transport and Communications, Mr Elias Kwandikwa told the National Assembly here that the government’s intention was to ensure that the project was completed within the shortest possible period, noting however, that the government would seriously consider any possible advice from lawmakers. He was responding to an advice issued by Nominated MP Salma Kikwete (CCM) and National Assembly Speaker Job Ndugai who expressed their dismay over heavy traffic jam for Kilwa Road users. The government’s assurance comes at a time when residents of Mbagala, Kongowe, Toangoma, Kisemvule and all the way to Lindi were being forced to spend hours in traffic jams due to the ongoing construction works. According to Ms Kikwete and Mr Ndugai, traffic jams along Kilwa Road had reached unbearable levels due to the ongoing thoroughfare construction. “The world is now like a village. While we were in Cairo, Egypt last week, I got information that some people travelling to Lindi spent four hours at Mbagala as they waited for their turns to move during the time that the contactor was working on the site. “The government must therefore come up with an alternative route. The situation is bad and it must be dealt with sooner than later,” said Mrs Kikwete, who comes from Lindi Region. The government, through the Ministry of Works, Transport and Communications, was currently building a road from Mbagala Rangi Tatu-Kongowe (3.8 kilometers) and the 17.5 kilometer stretch of the regional road from Kongowe – Mikwambe – Kibada – Mjimwema – Kivukoni Road. The construction involves upgrading the 3.8 kilometer Mbagala Rangi Tatu – Kongowe stretch from two ways to four ways. It also involved improvement of a bridge at Mzinga River.
