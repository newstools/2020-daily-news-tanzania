KAGERA Regional Commissioner (RC) Brig Gen Marco Gaguti has banned public gatherings and night discos during Easter. “People are warned against gatherings along L ake Victoria shores during Easter celebrations. The directives also involve discos and night gatherings. People should continue taking precautions against the spread of coronavirus and those who defy the directive will be punished,” he warned. He also appealed to on border villagers to be vigilant and report to relevant authorities if they suspected any alien as the region had porous borders and it was not possible to allocate police officers to each area. Kagera Region shares borders with three East African Community (EAC) member countries - Burundi, Rwanda and Uganda. Kagera Region reported its first suspected coronavirus patient a few weeks ago who was reported to have entered the country through Kabanga Entry Point in Ngara District. The patient was later confirmed to have contracted the coronavirus and was immediately sent to an isolation centre. Meanwhile, Bukoba Municipal Council has allocated an alternative bus station to mini-buses (Hiace) as precaution measures against the spread of coronavirus. Bukoba Municipal Council Executive Director Morice L imbe said the move aimed at reducing the congestion of vehicles and travellers. Only buses are allowed to continue using the main bus stand.
