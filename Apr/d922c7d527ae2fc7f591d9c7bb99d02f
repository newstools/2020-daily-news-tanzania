THE Minister of State in the President’s Office (Regional Administration and Local Governments), Mr Selemani Jafo said on Tuesday that the government has increased the budget for the Road Fund in the last five years by 33.18bn/-. Speaking in the National Assembly, the minister said the budget climbed from 218.55bn/-in 2015 to 251.73bn/-in 2020. The minister issued the statement following a question from Raphael Michael (Moshi-Urban, CCM) who wanted to know when the government will increase funds for the Tanzania Rural and Urban Roads Agency to be able to undertake its tasks efficiently. Mr Michael said TARURA especially in Moshi is facing financial challenges, which affects its plans to improve roads network in the municipality. “The roads’ condition in the Municipal is terrible,” he said, adding; “People are even wishing the agency was not established due to the fact that we had better roads before the establishment of the agency.” He asked the government to conduct a performance assessment of the agency since its establishment. “We need to conduct an assessment on the matter so that in case of challenges then the government will be in a good position to fix the problem,” he noted. In response, Mr Jafo said during the financial year 2020/21 the state is planning to release at least 275.03bn/-for the road fund. The fund according to the minister is prioritised for the renovation of key road infrastructures that had been affected by heavy rains. He said another plan under the government is to seek additional funding from development partners and other sources for emergencies.
