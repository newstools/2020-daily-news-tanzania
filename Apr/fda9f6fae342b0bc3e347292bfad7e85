MARA Regional Commissioner (RC), Adam Malima has warned that no one is above the law once it comes to handwashing as one of the measures taken to fight against Covid-19 across the country. The RC gave the warning at a market in Bunda at the weekend. Mr Malima said he would not tolerate any government official who would frustrate handwashing in the region. “I heard about the misunderstanding at Bunda Market. Those are my instructions and I am the regional commissioner,” Mr Malima emphasised. Last week’s reports went viral on social media that Bunda District Commissioner (DC), Lidya Bupilipili directed the arrest of some traders from the market after allegedly telling her to wash hands when the DC went at the market. “I don’t think that the DC rejected to wash her hands. Perhaps there was a misunderstanding,” RC Malima said. He said Mara Region had already recorded Covid-19 cases, thus residents must take care. The traders of Bunda Market thanked Mr Malima for visiting them and listening to the challenges facing them especially at this time when the pandemic was affecting trade and other development activities. The traders promised the regional commissioner that they would continue taking preventive measures against Covid-19.
