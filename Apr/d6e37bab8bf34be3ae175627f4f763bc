THE Kisutu Resident Magistrate’s Court in Dar es Salaam has ordered the arrest of the leader of Alliance for Change and Transparency (ACT) Wazalendo, Zitto Kabwe, for jumping bail in his sedition trial. The politician is allegedly linking the police force with killing over 100 people in Kigoma Region. Principal Resident Magistrate Huruma Shaidi gave such order today (Wednesday) after the opposition leader failed to show up. The Magistrate also noted that none of the sureties for the accused person showed up to explain his whereabouts. In the case, the prosecution alleges that the accused person committed the offences on October 28, 2018 at Kijitonyama area within Kinondoni District in Dar es Salaam, while holding a press conference at his party’s Headquarters. With intent to bring hatred to the citizens of the United Republic of Tanzania against the lawful authority of the government, the leader of the opposition party is alleged to have uttered several seditious words against the Tanzania Police Force.
