THE Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange (DSE) trading has been dominated by local investors for second week in a row as global markets feel the bite of covid-19. The virus pushed foreigners in lockdown to miss the show for consecutive two weeks thus pushing south total equity turnover by 3 1.7 per cent. Orbit Securities said in its weekly synopsis that total reported turnover dropped by 31.7 per cent to 4 5.4 6 m/- from a total volume of 0.29million shares. “Foreign investors are still tightened by the ongoing uncertainties of the coronavirus as global financial markets are still in a frenzy zone,” Orbit said.

The domestic market cap closed the week at 9.13 tri/-compared to the previous week’s 9.14 tri/- . The retreat of the domestic cap is due to the fall on the CRDB counter by 3.57 per cent to 13 5/- a share. The leading bank realized a turnover of 3 9.14 m/-, accounting for 86 per cent of the total equity turnover realized during the week. “The bank remains the most liquid counter on the market during this uncertain period,” Orbit said.
