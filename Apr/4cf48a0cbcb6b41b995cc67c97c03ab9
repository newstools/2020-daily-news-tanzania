Africa could become the next epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak, the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned. There was a sharp rise in cases in the past week. There have been almost 1,000 deaths and more than 18,000 infections across Africa so far, although these rates are far lower than those seen in parts of Europe and the US. The WHO says the virus appears to be spreading away from African capitals. It has also highlighted that the continent does not have enough ventilators to deal with a pandemic.
