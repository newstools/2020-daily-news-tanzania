ZANZIBAR government has formed a special expert committee to make detailed reviews on sweet pepper production project for the youth. Youth, Culture, Arts and Sports Minister Ambassador Ali Karume revealed the information while clarifying on the youth project for species and sweet pepper production. Minister Karume said the project was supposed to have started but had stalled due to some challenges. He said the government had set aside over 2bn/- for the project at Mahonda and Bumbwini’s PangaTupu area in Unguja North. “ I wish to inform members of the House that my ministry has already formed an expert committee to review in details the sweet pepper farming project and propose the most appropriate strategies to achieve more successes for the targeted beneficiaries,” the minister said. He said production of sweet pepper and other spices was one of the government’s goals to ensure Zanzibar youth get jobs and refrain from the ‘government is the lone employer’ syndrome. The minister said the government continues with its strategies to strengthen youth councils in all districts in Unguja and Pemba to attain their perceived goals. He described the councils as critical forums, which, if used appropriately, can help more youth to advance economically. Ambassador Karume said the councils were not established politically as claimed by some critics, saying the councils’ major goal is to facilitate economic empowerment of the youth. “We are determined to use the youth councils in all Unguja and Pemba districts to bring about great changes in economic development,” said the minister.
