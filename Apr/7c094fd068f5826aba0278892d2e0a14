AS global uncertainties still sustain due to the coronavirus, the Tanzania Share Index (TSI) slightly lost 1.37 points during the week that ended on the 03rd of April 2020. The TSI closed the week at 3,482.74 points as a result of a 0.04 per cent decline of the domestic market capitalization. The domestic market cap closed the week at 9.14tri/- ($3.97bln) compared to last week’s 9.14tri/- ($3.98bln). The woe of the TSI came from the long stable counter Twiga Cement (DSE: TPCC), slightly fell by 0.9 per cent during the week. TPCC was also the top mover for the week, accounting for 51 per cent of the total weekly equity turnover. TPCC moved 15,543 shares at a weekly average price of 2,184/-. The stability of TPCC has always been founded by the development and growth of the construction sector. Looks like investors are pricing in the possibility of a slowdown in infrastructure projects if a partial or total lockdown is put in place because of the virus. CRDB was the next top mover accounting for 41.5 per cent of the total equity turnover after moving 0.2mln shares at an average price of 135. The official closing price for the counter is still 140/- due to lack of sufficient traded volume to alter the price in one session. CRDB is currently the most liquid counter. During the week, more than 90 per cent of the total traded volume originated from the counter. The All Share Index (DSEI) on the other hand saw some light after gaining 17.96 points as the total market capitalization appreciated by 1.03 per cent. The total market closed the week at 1,757.59 points while the total cap closed at 14.59tri/- ($6.34bln). Most cross listed counters began climbing again, led by Jubilee Holdings which went up by 9.2 per cent. East African Breweries Ltd climbed 7.33 per cent and NMG jumped 1.96 per cent. KCB Bank tanked 2.63 per cent while Kenya Airways and Uchumi Supermarket remained stagnant. East African Breweries Ltd is looking forward to raise its stake in Serengeti Breweries Ltd (SBL) as the latter records significant growth in sales. During a period of six months to December 2019, SBL recorded 26 per cent upsurge in sales, making SBL the fastest growing unit for the EABL group. SBL contributed 12 per cent of the total revenue for the EABL group during the period. This shows the group’s confidence in Tanzania’s market, and expected to intensify competition to the local dominant, Tanzania Breweries Limited (TBL). Speaking of TBL reported a 5 per cent plummet in underlying revenue as a result of scaling down Dar brew operations. Due to increased operational efficiency as a result of restructuring that took place in the last three years, the group reported a 5 per cent upswing in operating profit and 13 per cent surge in EPS. TBL has already distributed 500/- per share as dividends during and for the year 2019. It is unclear if anymore dividend for the year 2019 shall be given out by the brewer. During the week, the TBL counter recorded zero activities despite the results release. The correlation between foreign investors’ participation and activities on TBL counter is vividly seen as foreign investors were missing in action during the week. The market was dominated by locals by 100 per cent on both, the buy and sell side. Market, Bills and Bonds The amount traded on the Interbank Money Market (IMM) went down for a third week in a row, by 4.1 per cent, to report a weekly total of 86bn/- ($37.36mln) compared to 89.7bn/- ($38.98mln) during the previous week. The interbank rate has also grown second week in a row, gaining 11bps during the week, to close the week at 4.7 per cent. Treasury bills auction held on the 01st of April 2020 was the third bills auction in a row to get undersubscribed. During the auction, the Bank of Tanzania offered the public a total of 107.2bn/- ($46.57mln) as usual, on four tenors. The public tender was less than half the offer, totalling to 50.11bn/- ($21.77mln), marking an undersubscription rate of 53.25 per cent. The public seems to be pushing back against lower yields by bidding less on the most dropping yield tenor, the 364 days. The Bank of Tanzania has also been pushing back by taking less than what was bided just to maintain lower Treasury yields. The 182 days tenor was oversubscribed by 33 per cent although the magnitude of the offer is significantly lower compared to the 364 days. The 35 days and 91 days tenors received zero bids. As a result of the push back by the Bank of Tanzania, the WAYTM dropped by 20bps compared to the previous auction. The WAYTM for the auction under review is 4.83 per cent. The WAYTM is down by 98bps since the beginning of February. Currency Market The shilling has been continuously depreciating day to day since mid-March as the deteriorated inflow caused by the coronavirus caught up to the economy. The shilling lost 58 pips during the week under review and has already lost 121 pips since it began depreciating. That is a depreciation of 0.05 per cent in two weeks. On the other hand, the amount traded grew by 65 per cent week on week, to a total of 4.38 million compared to 2.65 million during the previous week. The coronavirus is affecting major inflow corridors of tourism and commodity exports. The Tanzania Association of Tour Operators (TATO) reached a decision to halt all operations for 45 days beginning 01st April, and wait for government directives afterwards. The global industrial production slowdown is also deteriorating demand for raw commodities to feed factories. On the up-side for the shilling, there are low imports and lowered global demand has seriously lowered the price of oil which is a major import commodity for Tanzania.
