INTERNATIONAL Aids Conference has decided to hold the first ever virtual edition dubbed ‘Aids 2020: Virtual’ due to the outbreak of coronavirus. The decision has been arrived after the conference - the premier global platform to advance the HIV/Aids response - got advice from the World Health Organisation (WHO), the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/Aids (UNAIDS), leading global and local health authorities and people living with HIV/Aids around the globe. “In particular, we are aware that there is not yet sufficient data on whether people living with HIV/Aids are more susceptible to Covid-19 or more likely to develop severe disease. Therefore, we have a special obligation to reduce any potential risk to the HIV/Aids community,” said Dr Anton Pozniak (MD), who is the conference President and Aids 2020 International Chair. Aids 2020: Virtual will enable delegates to access and engage with the latest HIV/Aids science, advocacy and knowledge traditionally presented at the conference. It is expected to be a compelling combination of virtual sessions and community networking, including exhibitions, workshops, the global village, satellites and pre-conferences that will reach audiences around the world. Dr Pozniak remarked in his statement made available to ‘Daily News’ that the health and safeguarding of the community was their highest priority. “In light of the Covid-19 pandemic, the 23rd International Aids Conference (Aids 2020), to be held on July 6-10, 2020, will become the first virtual edition of the International Aids Conference,” he noted.
