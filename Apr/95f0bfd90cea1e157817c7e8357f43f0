DODOMA Regional Police Commander (RPC), Gilles Muroto said individuals engaging in car theft should find other legal means to earn their living as the law enforcers will leave no stone unturned until the malpractice is contained. RPC Muroto said of late the designated capital has been experiencing increasing incidents of car theft. Speaking to reporters, the RPC said they have embarked on a special operation to crack down on car theft offenders while calling on car owners to exercise extra security measures. Moreover, he cautioned the public against unnecessary gatherings during the Easter holiday festive season since the nation is involved in the fight against coronavirus. He wanted those in possession of stolen vehicles to surrender them to the police because unofficial garages will be traced down since they are in one way or another linked to the increasing number of car theft in the Capital City. Mr Muroto said vehicles that are highly targeted by the robbers includes those which use key censors because they just need key programming to have the car moving, unlike the traditional ones. “I advise vehicle owners to be extra careful as the police launches a manhunt of the offenders, they should take security measures like setting car track systems or install CCTV cameras in their compounds for easy identification of the thieves when the need arises” he insisted. Mr Muroto said car owners must keep a close watch on car wash attendants and their mechanical technicians because they might be a link to the thieves. Spare part dealers and shops have also been directed to ensure they have in their stores genuine items with all legal documents so that they don’t end up selling spare parts from stolen vehicles, because they will not be spared. The RPC wanted the public to give details of unofficial garages as they are the centre points of attraction for stolen vehicles and thieves where they reframe the cars to lose its original identity or dismantle them for spare parts.
