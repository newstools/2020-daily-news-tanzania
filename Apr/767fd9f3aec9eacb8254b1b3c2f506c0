TANZANIANS have been urged to pray for other Christians worldwide who didn’t have the opportunity to celebrate Easter as a result of Covid-19 caused by coronavirus. Giving his homily during Easter Sunday Mass held at Christ the King Cathedral in Moshi, Kilimanjaro Region, Bishop Ludovick Joseph Minde (ALCP/OSS) said: “There are our brothers and sisters in Christ in various places across the world who need our prayers due to the fact that we have been granted the grace to celebrate Easter directly from the houses of worship,” he said. He noted that: “We received the gift from God to observe Easter proceedings as from Thursday, Good Friday and today, including Easter Eve. Let use this gift then to pray for those who didn’t get this opportunity.” Bishop Minde noted that prayers by Tanzanians during this year's Easter would help those who didn’t get the opportunity to observe Easter in churches to know that God had not forsaken them and that he was still with them. "The situation is not good for some of our brothers and sisters outside there. I spoke to the Archbishop of Mombasa in Kenya who told me that the situation there was not good and he asked me and you to pray for them.” He reiterated his appeal to believers to continue following directives provided by the government and health experts to avoid coronavirus. Bishop Minde also urged believers to use the Easter celebration to return to God in repentance while focusing on the values in their social positions, including in the workplace. "It is true that we have completed Lent, but repentance is not over. Let us continue with it to cultivate good values in ourselves and this is the real meaning of Easter," he said.
