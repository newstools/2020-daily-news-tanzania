TANZANIA Building Agency (TBA) has given an assurance that it will complete construction of modern silos in Rukwa, Katavi and Manyara regions before July this year. The project that is jointly implemented in partnership between Tanzania and Poland targets to construct another silo with a capacity to store 25,000 tonnes of agricultural produce of the National Food Reserve Agency (NFRA). The revelation was made here yesterday by TBA Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Daudi Kondoro, adding that: “Initially the project was supposed to be completed in December last year, but hit by some technical snags, including customs disputes, climate change and change of location slowed its implementation schedules…but we’re confident it will be completed this June.” Hinting, he said the construction work was designed for Songwe, Shinyanga, Dodoma, Songea, Katavi and Manyara region, but change of Songwe initial site altered the whole implementation chain. However, records from the Ministry of Agriculture indicates that the project implemented in (Mpanda) Katavi and Sumbawanga (Rukwa) worth 28.2bn/- and has been executed by a Polish firm- UNIA Araj Realiczje. Commenting on the project, the Minister for Agriculture, Japhet Hasunga, said upon its completion, the NFRA Rukwa division would a  silo capable of storing some 58,500 tonnes of cereals, and Katavi 28,000 tonnes. However, he pointed out that the government will not extend time to the contractor, but instead want quality work handed over as earlier agreed in the tender contract. In response, Mr Kondoro assured that the agency has enough technology and tools required to construct any modern silos needed by the national food agency. Equally, he emphasized that the delay in completing the project was not intentional thing, for it is their task to oversee complete construction work realised. “The problem we experienced involved some equipment being held by the Ports Authority and tax clearance not completed on time,” he said.
