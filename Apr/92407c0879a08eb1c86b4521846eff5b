Britain's Queen Elizabeth has asked that there be no gun salutes to mark her birthday on Tuesday for the first time during her 68-year reign amid the coronavirus pandemic. The monarch, who is set to turn 94 while residing at Windsor Castle, has also said Government buildings will be exempt from flying flags if it creates a problem. Elizabeth II said she did not feel gun salutes would be appropriate in the circumstances of the crisis, which has claimed more than 14,000 lives in Britain. Gun salutes, in which blank rounds are fired across the UK, are typically used by the Royal Family to mark special occasions such as anniversaries and birthdays.
