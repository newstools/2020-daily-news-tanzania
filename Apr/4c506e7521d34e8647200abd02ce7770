NORTH Mara Gold Mine (NMGM) has donated items worth 37m/- to Tarime District and Referral Regional Hospital in Musoma to intensify COVID 19 battle in Mara Region. The items included 120 hand washing tanks each with 200 litres capacity, bottles of sanitisers, gumboots and hazmat suits for health staff, who would take care of any coronavirus suspect. “These are preventive equipment to protect the community and health workers. It is our responsibility as an investor to support efforts speeded by the government to fight covid-19 in Tanzania,” said the mine’s Occupational Health and Safety Manager, Dr Nicholas Mboya, while handing over the items to Tarime District authorities. The list also included five scan thermometers (infrared), which will be placed in every entry point across Tanzania-Kenya borders in Tarime. Welcoming the assistance, Tarime District Commissioner (DC) Eng Mtemi Msafiri (pictured) said the preventive gears will also be placed in Churches, markets and Mosques. “The scan thermometers will be helpful in checking temperatures of people along the border in several stations,” Eng Msafiri said. The Infrared, he said will further help in screening people, who are going under quarantine in the district to ensure that the area is free from the pandemic. The DC pointed out that some of the items will also be provided to small scale miners in the district.
