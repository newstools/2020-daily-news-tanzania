The US virus death toll has surpassed 50,000, BBC quotes latest data from Johns Hopkins University. According to the varsity's data, this is the world's deadliest Covid-19 outbreak. More than 3,000 deaths came in the last 24 hours, and there are now over 870,000 confirmed cases nationwide, the report added. "But the US still has a lower mortality rate than most European nations based on current case counts, as the White House task force has emphasised," the report added. Recent rises are also likely due to the inclusion of "probable" virus deaths.
