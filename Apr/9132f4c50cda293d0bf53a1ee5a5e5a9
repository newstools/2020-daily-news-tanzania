MANYARA Regional Commissioner (RC), Alexander Mnyeti has alerted residents and visitors to stay safe against coronavirus that causes COVID-19. RC Mnyeti said everybody must abide by what health experts and government officials order so as to control spread of the deadly virus that has hit most parts of Europe and the United States of America.

He issued the directives while touring Mati Super Brand Ltd that produces and sells spirits and has since started collaboration with the government to produce sanitizers. "We have to strive and protect ourselvesâ€“stay safe, and that is what we can do as a country and people so that the virus does not infect more people, which will be hard to manage. It will bother us so much," said DC Mnyeti. He commended the management of Mati for producing sanitizers and selling at a price advised by the government, adding that they should move forward in more production to ensure Manyara residents and visitors stay safe. Manyara Regional Administrative Secretary (RAS), Mr Missaile Musa said the product is helpful, saying he will contact all district authorities to ensure that they get the product for their people, especially in areas where there is water scarcity. Mati Super Brand Ltd Managing Director, Mr David Mulokozi said they decided to produce sanitizers to support the people of Manyara to get protected from COVID-19.
