CONTRACTORS carrying out the Rural Energy Agency (REA) projects to supply power to peri-urban areas across the country have two months to complete the projects. Energy Minister, Dr Medard Kalemani, issued the ultimatum during a recent meeting with the power supply project contractors here, pointing out that the contractors should complete all power projects by June this year. “All contractors implementing the projects should develop a special plan to ensure all power projects are complete by June this year. The plan should point out villages without electricity and timeframe to reach them,” remarked the Minister. Dr Kalemani urged them to work hard to ensure that the power supply work is complete within the timeframe. “Contractors should also submit lists of villages and areas to receive electricity to Regional Commissioners, District Commissioners and Village Chairpersons in order to enable them make followup,” he said. Dr Kalemani directed that all electric posts that were abandoned should be installed, and electric posts without electricity cables should be complete immediately for community members to get access to electricity. On her part, Deputy Energy Minister, Ms Subira Mgalu, called on contractors to speed up the projects for community members to get access to electricity as soon as possible. She expressed optimism that they will work on the directives issued by the Minister to complete the power supply projects by June.
