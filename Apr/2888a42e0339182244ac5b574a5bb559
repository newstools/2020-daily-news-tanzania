ZANZIBAR House of Representatives’ ordinary session kicked off on Thursday with nine Bills lined up for deliberations before the legislature switches to the eagerly awaited 2020/21 budget session. Clerk of the House of Representatives Raya Mselem said in a press release that during the two-week ordinary session, which precedes the budget meeting, all required precautions against the spread of the deadly novel virus would be taken. She said the lawmakers and the House staff had been informed about the changes in running of sessions, including social distancing by reducing the number of hours and legislators/ministers, discouraging visitors and the emphasis on hands wash and use of sanitisers. “The government through Ministry of Health has issued guidelines and advice. We must keenly follow what has been directed to help curb the contagion which has already claimed thousands of lives globally,” she said. Ms Msellem urged legislators and members of the public to join forces in the fight against Covid-19, saying the current situation needed concerted effort from all Tanzanians, including members of the House and the media. She mentioned the proposed Bills for tabling and debating during the session as the President’s Act of 1993 (for amendment), the Diaspora Act, the Weights and Measures Act of 1983 (for repeal) and a Bill to establish a research institute. Other Bills for tabling are the Registration and Supervision of Medical Lab Technicians Act, a Bill to establish a medical research institute and the Liquor Act (for repeal).
