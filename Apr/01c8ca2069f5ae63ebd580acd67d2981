LOCAL contractors have met Tarime District Council authorities here to discuss how best to spend 5.7b/-in development projects that has been set aside by the North Mara Mine through its Cooperate Social Responsibility (CSR). The giant miner stationed in Nyamongo town has released the funds in the 2019/20 development plan that will be spent on  implementing health, education and infrastructure  projects in  the surrounding 11 villages envisioned  to help residents adjacent to the mining area  to improve their livelihoods. According to Tarime District Executive Director (DED), Apoo Tindwa, the local contractors will be given priority as one of the council's initiatives to boost incomes amongst Tarime residents as well as creating indirect employment for  hundreds of youth adjacent to the mining site. ''We intend to create awareness to the unemployed youth around the investment area, especially in Nyamongo town, to utilize the opportunity by taking part in manual activities once the local contractors commence work in the near future as one way of helping the people to reap the fruits of adjacent investments,'' he said. He cautioned that  local contractors who will be selected by the district tender board after meeting the required criteria should implement the projects at high standards in order to attain the value for money. According to the director, the first phase implementation of the project is scheduled to commence next month at the cost of 2.1b/-. He told the contractors that the main aim of the council development planners was to ensure that the community funds released by the miner benefits the whole district by helping in educating and improving the health standards of the surrounding community. According to the mine's community relations officer, Richard Ojendo for the first time the North Mara mine has started to grant tenders to local contractors aimed at raising their income as well as improving its social cooperate responsibilities.
