LEADERS here have continued to receive aid for Covid- 19 from development partners, recommending to people here to start wearing masks to limit the spread of the coronavirus. Second Vice-President, Ambassador Seif Ali Iddi said this while receiving bed sheets and 30 thermometer guns used to check for temperature, where he said that the use of a mask will help reduce transmission. The aid was donated by a local businessman, Mr Said Nassor Bopar, who promised continued support. “We ask local producers to produce enough masks at affordable prices so that all people can buy and use as they go out of their homes. Use of masks and social distancing remains crucial in the war against Covid-19,” Mr Iddi said. Cloth masks are now being recommended because it is easy and not expensive to make, and are reusable and help reduce transmission of the disease by acting like a shield to contain the respiratory droplets through which the virus spreads. Health officers also advised people against touching or removing their masks unnecessarily while outside their home, as they emphasize on regular hand washing and washing of reusable masks, and to avoid overuse of disposable masks. Meanwhile, the Minister for Trade and Industries, Ambassador Amina Salum Ali received Muslim Holy books (Koran), from an NGO based in Kuwait, where she said that prayers to God remain a vital weapon to win against coronavirus. “At this time of fasting for Muslims, it is important to pray for mercy and win against the Covid-19 pandemic which has disrupted our lives,” Ms Amina said. The messages come at a time when the number of recorded Covid-19 cases in Zanzibar has surpassed 100, but with many recovering from the disease which was first recorded in Zanzibar on March 18, this year.
