Two people who fled a quarantine centre in Kenya have been arrested at a bar where they were found drinking despite social distancing regulations. They were among dozens of people filmed jumping over a wall of the facility in the capital, Nairobi, drawing public condemnation. While under arrest they said they had planned the escape because they were not getting tested for the virus. All bars in Kenya have been ordered to close, to halt the spread of Covid-19. The pair, who are now awaiting charges, had complained that they couldn't afford to pay for their confinement out of their own pockets.
