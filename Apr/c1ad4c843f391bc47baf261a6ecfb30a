THE Rukwa Regional Commissioner(RC) Mr Joachim Wangabo has appealed to the citizens to fully participate in preventive measures in concerted efforts to check the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Similarly, the RC urged citizens living close to the border as well as shoreline of Lake Tanganyika in Kalambo and Nkasi districts to report immediately aliens who enter the country through illegal routes. Mr Wangabo was speaking to local functionaries and councillors from Kipili, Kirando and Kitete at a brief meeting held at Nkasi Secondary School in Nkasi District. “Our region has a porous border as well as more than 50 illegal ports on Lake Tanganyika.....this makes very difficult to assign immigration and police officers to each area,” added the RC. He emphatically appealed to citizens to wash their hands regularly with water and soap as well as sanitizing themselves. “Citizens should cover their nose and mouth with disposable tissues or a flexed elbow when they cough or sneeze; they should also avoid contact with people who are unwell and stay home and self isolate from others in the house once any individual feels unwell. We should not relax because the pandemic is real and is a global emergency,” stressed the RC.
