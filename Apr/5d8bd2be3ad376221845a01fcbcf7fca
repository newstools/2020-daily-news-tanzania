THE national telecommunication project that would ensure all villages in the country are connected to communication networks is scheduled to begin in September this year, it has been revealed. Ministry of Works, Transport and Communication told the Parliament that through the Universal Communications Service Access Fund (UCSAF), more villages will be reached with telecommunication services in the fifth phase. The government said this in a written response to a question by the Igalula MP, Mussa Ntimizi (CCM), who wanted to know when the government would put in place telecommunication network in parts of constituency. The lawmaker argued that Mlale Ward and all villages in it have no communication network just like Loya Ward, where Migongwa and Mugulyati villages do not have connection, adding: “What is the government doing in efforts to let the area residents have communication network?” The ministry, in response admitted that the government was aware of the communication network problem in Igalula Constituency, especially in the villages of  Mlale, Loya and Tura Wards, adding that they have all been included in the fifth phase project. Also some villages of Magulyati and Migongwa in Loya Ward have been included in the communication network during the first phase on 8th March,2013 under a project implemented by Tigo, said the government. On the other hand villages in two other Wards of Munyu, Tura and Nkonywa  have been  included in a project under  implementation  by Airtel  since 24th January,2020. The project is to commence in October,2020.
