TANZANIA Bureau of Standard (TBS) has reiterated call upon the members of public to report dishonest people who trade and import substandard PVC pipes used for wiring works. The government’s quality agency noted that low-quality PVC pipes were causing loss to buyers as well as affecting country’s economy. The pipes are mainly used for wiring in buildings and other structures in the country. “We know that there are deceitful individuals and companies engage in producing and supplying of fake PVC pipes. The important matter here is that we are urging citizens to cooperate with us by giving information when then notice such wrong doing,” Ms R hoida Andusamilie, TBS Head of Public R elations department, said on Monday. She said however the bureau was conducting regular inspections in industries, market and at ports to identify the dishonest traders and producers. One of local producers of the PVC, Mr Mansoor Moiz, from Africab Tanzania, admitted that some local manufacturers were producing and bringing to the market the low-quality PVC, something which was causing loss to buyers. Mr Moiz opinioned that Tanzania was stepping ahead in PVC production, but the challenge remained over presence of some industries failing to adhere to quality standards “It has been difficult to identify those responsible because they don’t put their identity on the products,” he said. He added: “building company’s brand takes time, and the manufacturers have to have patience and follow standards as directed by the TBS than engaging in such illegal business.” Mr Moiz appealed to fellow producers to adhere to TBS standards in order to avoid effects in the public such as fire accidents as results of substandard PVC pipes. He further argued that lying electric wires underground needed high quality PVC pipes; otherwise, it may lead to leakage of pipes and consequently causing big effects.
