LUPA Member of parliament Victor Mwambalaswa has questioned why the government decided to make a U-turn on the earlier decision to have a major road traverse the southern region. This emerged yesterday during the question and answer session of the parliament, when the MP stated that the Great North Road was contrary to the Government’s notice which had initially stated that the road would go through Mbeya, Iringa, Dodoma, Babati, Arusha and Namanga. In his question, Mr Mwambalaswa stated that the road that was branded “The Great North Road” was to go through Tunduma, Mbeya, Chunya, Itigi, Manyoni, Singida, Babati, Arusha and reach its destination at Namanga. In the response, the Ministry of Works, Transport and Communications said that there were no clear records on that road and that was why it passed through Tunduru, Mbeya, Chunya, Itigi, Manyoni, Singida, Babati, Arusha to Namanga. The ministry further stated that there was another road that was also beneficial which starts in South Africa, in Cape Town to Botswana, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Tanzania, Kenya, Ethiopia, Sudan ending up in Cairo, Egypt (about 10,288 kilometers). In the mainland Tanzania, the road will go through Songwe, Mbeya, Njombe, Iringa, Dodoma, Manyara and Arusha.
