TANZANIAN Alfred Selengia has expressed his appreciations to the Confederation of African Volleyball for appointing him to be the continental trainer effective from this April, 2020. Selengia who also serves as the Secretary General of the Tanzanian Volleyball Association (TAVA) said he feels privileged to be chosen among and above other potential volleyball trainers in Africa. Speaking of his new appointment, Selengia revealed that out of 50 candidates, he was among the only 12 instructors selected; among them six from Franco-phone countries and six others representing Anglophone countries. “On the Tanzanian side, we have several programmes, including grooming national instructors as well as recruiting new volleyball coaches from Primary and Secondary Schools,” he said, adding that the events will resume after the Covid-19 curfew is lifted. At the moment Tanzania has a total of five volleyball trainers, but once the new programmes are rolled out, the number is set to increase. “There is also ample opportunity in volleyball because 90 per cent of all mainland regions have registered their local clubs,” said the trainer. “We are currently sending official letters to leaders of clubs across the nation, instructing the regions to prepare themselves for volleyball courses once sports activities resume,” added the instructor.
