AS House of Representatives prepare to start its session, members of the House social welfare permanent committee have warned the Ministry of Education and Vocational Training against substandard school buildings. “We no longer want to get reports about shoddy work of schools projects; You have to ensure quality and standard work by keeping an open eye on the projects for good results and value for money,” the House committee members said. The committee led by Ms MwanaAsha Khamis Juma issued the warning following an evaluation report on the finished new buildings, indicating poor construction that has led to roof leakage during rain, and floor & wall cracks. Following complains from students, and teachers about the newly built buildings after the House was prompted to probe, finding out that some schools were poorly constructed, a loss of funds. In a meeting with executives at the Ministry, the House committee members said engineers and construction companies should be held accountable for any poor work of the schools projects. Mr Abdalla Mzee Abdalla- deputy Permanent Secretary in the Ministry promised to be careful and observe regulations regarding constructions in the country, and that ongoing and future projects will be carefully monitored.
