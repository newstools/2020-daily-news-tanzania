The shilling weighted average exchange rate dropped by 47 pips to 2,301/17 against a US dollars in a trading week ending last Friday.

During the week IFEM transactions went down 66 per cent to 2.65 million US dollars from previous week’s 7.85million US dollars. Tanzania Securities said in the interbank money market weighted average yield expected to have slightly volatility on high and low rates. “…N otwithstanding the decrease in weighted average rate during the week we anticipate that weighted average yield to be within a range of 4.50per cent to 5.00per cent with slight volatility in the high and low rate,” Tanzania Securities said in its weekly Blast Report. Economists have it that corona is expected to stress foreign currency inflows due to lowered exports and deceleration of tourism. “Increasing imports and stressed tourism inflows shall put pressure on the shilling,” Mr Imani Muhingo, an economist and Head of Research and Analytic at Orbit Securities, said.
