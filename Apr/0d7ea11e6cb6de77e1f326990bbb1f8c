FISHERMEN at Ferry fish market have said poor technology is the major cause for fluctuation of fish supply particularly on rainy or windy weather season. Vice-chairman of the Dar es Salaam small scale fishers’ association (UWAWADA), Mr Saleh Msaen said in Dar es Salam yesterday that high tech fishing gear may help them to go fishing into deep water even in bad weather. The ‘Daily News’ survey established that fresh fish prices at Ferry fish market have gone up exponentially with fishers not fearing the outbreak of coronavirus in their work but blaming the down pouring seasonal rains amid low technology used for fish catch. Beginning this week, a twenty-kilogram bucket of sardine will be sold at up to 45/-from 30/-, previously. Other types of small size fish have seen the price shoot to 55/-from the normal price of 35/-for a 20-kgm bucket. “The main challenge faced is that we can’t catch fish at deeper level of the sea for we are incapable of casting nets deeply,” he said. He said that the hard situation was caused by the fact the ongoing seasonal rains are increasing the amount of cold water into the sea through river tributaries, which causes the fish to swim deeper into the sea in search of saline water. “This makes our catch more difficulty as we don’t have modern technology to support deepest sea fishing; We end up into losses which jeopardises our business and livelihood,” he said. He said that a boat, which sails with up to 12 fishermen, is forced to dock back to the beach after 11 days as working and basic needs runs off. “After 10 days in the sea, they (Fishers) need fuel for boat engines, food and ice bars to store few catches,” Insisted Msean.
