Rukwa residents have been urged to take precautionary measures and observe directives issued by the government and health experts to protect themselves against deadly Covid-19. Speaking during his visit to inspect the construction of modern silos at Kanondo Village on the outskirts of Sumbawanga Town, Rukwa Regional Commissioner (RC) Joachim Wangabo warned people with symptoms of the novel virus against intermingling with others to avoid further disease transmission. "Residents must take precautionary measures, including handwashing and adhering to government and health expertsâ€™ directives to protect themselves against the novel virus," added the RC. Equally, the RC directed project manager from Tanzania Building Agency (TBA) Resident Engineer Haruna Kalunga to ensure sufficient equipment for handwashing, including sanitisers were available in the workplace. The projects are implemented in Katavi (Mpanda) and Rukwa (Sumbawanga) at 28.2bn/-. The Polish government has issued a soft loan to the government via National Food Reserve Agency (NFRA). The RC further said the Polish Engineering Company, UNIA Araj Realiczje, had been contracted to implement the project, but had sub-contracted it to Arusha-based Ekerai Co Ltd. The project took off on September last year and is expected to be completed on March 3, next year. Explaining further, TBA Resident Engineer Kalunga briefed the RC that Rukwa Region would have NFRA storage facilities with the capacity of storing 58,000 tonnes of cereals while Katavi Region would have the capacity to store 28,000 tonnes.
