TANZANIA Building Agency (TBA), has announced plans to build additional 150 residential houses for public servants in Dodoma. This will be part of addressing housing shortage in the new government administrative capital. TBA Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Daudi Kondoro told 'Daily News' yesterday that 800 houses that the public landlord retained after the dismissal of the capital development authority are not sufficient to accommodate the demand for housing in the city. “We have requested for the budget approval, and luckily the ministry’s budget has so far been endorsed by the parliamentary committee and awaits the National Assembly for final decision,” he said. He detailed that the proposed houses will be built at the agency’s land at Itega and Nzuguni suburbs in the city. “Our plan is to ensure all civil servants have a place to stay,” Arch Kondoro noted. TBA is in charge of managing all public structures, including civil servants housing. It has recently expanded into construction work of affordable houses that it later sales to civil servants and private individuals," he said. He reminded tenants however to clear their debts as per initial agreement, especially in buildings that it acquired after the dismissal of CDA by President John Magufuli in May 2017. Arch Kondoro further said that the agency is completing work on rehabilitating all the structures, including painting them with TBA identity, but was quick to note that the agency expects much of the work to be funded from debt collection. So far, he said rehabilitation is on-going in Dodoma and Dar es Salaam. Meanwhile, the TBA boss said the agency is working with a state examiner to establish ownership legality of all public structures across the country. The goal, according to Mr Kondoro, is to ensure every government house is re-identified, given that some dishonest people had maneuvered their way to obtain false ownership of the state properties.
