Japan is said to be increasing its stockpile of a flu drug that scientists believe could help treat Covid-19. The drug, called Avigan or favipiravir, was used by doctors in China to treat some of the first patients in Wuhan, where the coronavirus outbreak began. Two trials in the country suggested the drug shortened recovery time. Local media say Japan is hoping to triple production from current levels, so that there will be enough to treat 2m people. The drug is made by a subsidiary of camera company Fujifilm. It has begun clinical trials that will run until the end of June. The therapy is still unproven and may have side effects, experts warn, but it is one of many being explored to fight the virus.
