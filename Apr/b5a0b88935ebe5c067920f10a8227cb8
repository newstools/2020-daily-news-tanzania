THE prosecution in a corruption case facing prominent Arusha businessman Shabiby Virjee and two others will have nine witnesses to testify against the accused. Before Arusha Principal Resident Magistrate Martha Mahumbaga, Prevention and Combatting of Corruption Bureau (PCCB), Hamidu Simbano said the nine witnesses would as well tender to the court 10 documents if admitted in court. The case that has drawn interest from Arusha residents in which with Virjee (34), other accused are police officer PC 8683 Paulo Erasmo (37) and an employee with Oryx Oil Company, Nkenzi Pazi (38). The prosecution read the charges to the accused who all entered a plea of not guilty. Mr Simbano told the Court that they were ready to start tendering evidence with oral testimony of a witness or the production of physical evidence- oral testimony and consequent production of physical evidence. The Court decided that those who were responsible to tender evidence would start entering the witness box April 24, this year. The crux of the case is that the prosecution alleges that the trio in December last year conspired to bribe a police officer 10m/-to do them a favour knowing that it was against the law. Mr Simbano alleged that they influenced another police officer, Staff Sergeant, Meshack Laizer to receive the money to distract a case facing Virjeeâ€™s son Ilphran Virjee and facilitate getting him off the hook. They found PC Erasmo, gave him the money to hand it over on their behalf to Staff Sergeant Laizer who would in turn ensure Ilphran was set free. On their way to accomplish their mission, the prosecution further alleged, were intercepted and arrested by the police led by Staff Sergeant Laizer. The accused are defended by Mr Godluck Maico and Mr Sambo Gwakisa.
