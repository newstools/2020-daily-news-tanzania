THE Prevention and Combating of Corruption Bureau (PCCB) in Rukwa Region has held four leaders of Uwami Saccos Ltd for allegedly attempting to defraud 45.5 m/- meant to pay retired school teachers who were members of the cooperative society. According to reports, so far three retired school teachers, who were members of Uwami Saccos Ltd, have died before being paid their money. Uwami Saccos Ltd based here was established in 2004 and its members are primary and secondary school teachers whose membership ends after they retire. After the three suspects were grilled and put under custody for four days they agreed to refund 11,541,750/- and surrendered the money to PCCB which in turn handed it to 13 teachers who retired five years ago. Rukwa Regional PCCB Chief Hamza Mwenda named the four suspects as Uwami Saccos Ltd chairperson Marietha Haule, Alexander Zumba, Anicet Lyela and Benard Msika while the fifth suspect whose identity was not made public was still at large. During the handover of the money during a brief celebration held at the PCCB regional office Mr Mwenda handed the recovered money to the chairman of 13 retired teachers, Mr Grayson Mwasumbi.
