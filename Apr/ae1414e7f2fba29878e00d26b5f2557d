DEEPLY affected and concerned, we sincerely urge sportmen, women and the entire sports fraternity engaged in the combat against COVID-19 to keep calm and wait, as the threat is still there. We know many are hoping to see resumption of sport activities, but the government’s extension of hiatus until further notice indicates the danger as efforts to alleviate the pandemic continues steadily. It is very important to understand that the environment is not safe to resume sport activities, but we hope everything will return to normal when the current threat of COVID-19 is totally curbed. We, as among the big stakeholders of sports, hoped that the indefinite break to all sport activities as one measure to contain the spread of the coronavirus would be enough, but unfortunately the danger is there and the number of victims keeps increasing. We know how sportsmen and women and supporters are affected by the current situation, but our health and lives are very important, hence we need to continue observing safety rules and avoid engaging ourselves in activities and events that are of a huge public nature to avoid contact. We commend the government’s wise decision since it came after proof from the National Coordination Task Force Committee in charge of the fight against the spread of COVID-19 pandemic that convened in Dodoma that indicated that the situation has not improved. We again tell the sport fraternity that sports will only resume when the government finds it safe to do so. While we call upon sportsmen and women to keep calm and hopeful during this hard time, we also urge them to adhere to all precautionary measures to avoid contracting the COVID-19, since people’s health is more important than anything else. We conclude by saying, Tanzanians, just like others worldwide, need to know that the fight against COVID-19 spread will be successful when everyone strictly observes directives given by health experts to limit and finally break the transmission chain.
