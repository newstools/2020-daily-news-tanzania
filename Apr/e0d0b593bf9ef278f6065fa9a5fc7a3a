DESPITE  the government  move to announce  indicative prices  for retail sugar  per kilogram  in each region  traders  in Mwanza  City are still reluctant  to sell the product  at 2,900/-as set  for  the region. Most shops in  the city sell the commodity at between 3,200/-and 3,500/-per kilo, contrary to the indicative price set for Mwanza Region. A spot check by 'Sunday News' learnt that the sweetener was sold above the indicative price with very few traders abiding by the government directive. Wholesale price for a 25 kilogram bag of sugar is sold at between 68,000/-and 72,000/-and 75,000/- which means that  traders buy the commodity at 2,720/-, 2,880/-and 3,000/-, which could  automatically hike the  retail price. Recently, the government through Minister for Agriculture, Mr Japheth  Hasunga, announced indicative prices to end illegal practices by some traders who have been increasing prices to maximise profits. He said indicative prices were  considered by considering importation costs incurred by local producers to cover the shortage of the commodity and the distance to the destination; therefore in Mwanza the indicative price is 2900/-. Mr Hasunga said sugar shortage in the country was due to hostile weather, and as a result, local factories failed to produce a lot of sugar to meet consumers’ demand, and that was why the government allowed importers to import the commodity to reduce shortages. A retailer along Uhuru Street,  Mr Manyangu Saguda said he was selling sugar at 3,500  per kilo since he buys it at for 3,000 per kilogram; He was thus waiting for wholesellers to reduce prices for him also to also  reduce the retail prices. A food vendor along Miti Mirefu Street, Ms Nkwimba Sayi, said due to the sugar price hike, they don’t get enough profit.
