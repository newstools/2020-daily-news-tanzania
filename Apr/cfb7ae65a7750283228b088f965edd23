TANZANIA economy is expected to grow in the coming years from the grass roots, thanks to the electricity connection to people who reside in rural areas. Minister for Energy, Dr Medard Kalemani told the parliament recently that the government has so far spent a total of 2.8 trl/- in connecting electricity to rural areas. The Minister was speaking during the winding up of the Prime Minister’s budget estimates in the House last week. He said the government is committed to connect all villages to electricity under the Rural Energy Agency (REA). According to Dr Kalemani, so far Tanzania is number one in Africa for being able to connect its villages and enable its citizens to access electricity services. It is followed by South Africa and Nigeria. He said two years ago, Tanzania was positioned number four with 58 per cent connection in rural areas. “We were on number four in 2018, we had managed to cover 58 per cent of rural areas with electricity, things changed in December 2019 and we were moved to third position and as I speak now, the February statistics show that Tanzania is leading in Africa,” he said. Dr Kalemani said electricity connection in various parts of the country has boosted various economic activities including establishment of industries and enable the public to engage in production. “Many youth have been able to establish small industries, they are now capable of processing raw materials and manufacture some products, this is a big achievement to our country, and we are looking forward to witness economic growth,” he said.
