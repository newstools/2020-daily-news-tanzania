THE third edition of Mirjam East Africa Volleyball Championship that was scheduled to be held June this year in Mwanza has officially been cancelled. The annual competition that was being organised by Home Life Sports (HOLIS) of Mwanza was expected to draw teams from East African Community (EAC) and held at Mirongo Sports Centre in Mwanza City from 24th -27th June. HOLIS Chairman Majaliwa Mayunga said yesterday that the cancellation of the tournament is due to global threat of Covid-19 "I want to inform all volleyball stakeholders that we have been forced to announce that the Mirjam East Africa event will not take place this year as we earlier planned. "We hope that things will later change for the better and allow us to prepare and organise wonderful tournament next year," said Mayunga. He extended their apology for the entire volleyball fraternity that includes teams and players for missing this year’s showpiece. However, Mayunga has assured them that HOLIS will not sleep and come up with other tournaments this year once the situation improves to the better. "I would like also to advice the volleyball family and Tanzanians in general to adhere to all instructions given by the health experts that will prevent them from Covid-19 and stay safe," he stressed. Last week HOLIS Communication officer, David Mabula admitted to this paper that ongoing coronavirus crisis had disturbed their preparation for the tournament and warned of possible danger. The event was organised as part of the promotion of the game and was open both junior and senior teams. According to Mabula, they had extended invitation to foreign teams so as to make it a huge success while also giving local teams an international exposure after learning from others. Hefty packages that included cash prizes were to be awarded to the winners of this year’s event. That included 5m/-for the overall winners, 3m/-for the runners and 2m/- for the third-placed finishers. There were to be also individuals’ prizes.
