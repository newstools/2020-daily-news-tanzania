DEPUTY Minister for Works, Transport and Communications, Engineer Atashasta Nditiye, has appealed to residents in the Lake Regions of Mwanza, Kagera, Geita, Shinyanga and Mara to increase production of both cash and food crops as the rehabilitation of MV Victoria nears completion. He noted that the rehabilitation of MV Victoria and MV Butiama had reached almost 98 per cent, costing approximately 22.8bn/-. “We are grateful to President John Magufuli for his bold decision to improve Lake Victoria transport. A new ship is being built and has reached almost 65 per cent,” he said. Engineer Nditiye noted that MV Victoria, with capacity to carry 1,200 passengers, has been overhauled completely and is now fitted with new engines, propellers and three standby generators. “MV Victoria is quite impressive. People in Lake Zone Regions should get ready to improve their economy through increased production of both cash and food crops. This is a great opportunity which should not be missed,” he remarked.

He also revealed that the handing over of MV Victoria will be made soon, as the exercise was delayed by the outbreak of coronavirus disease. “We are still waiting for experts from Korea who rehabilitated the two steamers, “he said
