THE government, through the Ministry of Water, has issued directives to ensure that sources of water are protected by avoiding all human activities that could lead to environmental impacts. Minister for Water Prof Makame Mbarawa told the Parliament on Thursday that to ensure protection of water sources, all people who live along water sources are required to protect them. “We have charted procedures and directives to guide people who use water in various sources to ensure that they engage them,” he said. He said among the measures the government is taking to that end is introduction of institutional systems that involve people who consume water in their various activities. To that end, every person is obliged to protect water sources in valleys, forests and on land, pointing out that this was in compliance with the Water Resources Management Act, 2009, alongside with water and environmental protection laws. This Act makes provision for the management, use and protection of water resources - water courses, surface water, and ground and estuary waters. The Act sets out fundamental principles of water use and conservation. It also states preferences in water allocation. The minister was responding to Kaliua MP Magdalena Sakaya (CUF), who wanted to know how the government involves stakeholders in protecting water sources.
