THE government has been urged to reinforce measures, which will tackle teachers and instructors’ shortage especially in technical colleges across the country. The parliamentary committee on Social Services and Community Development said here that human resources must not be treated as ‘a thing we do,’ but rather ‘the thing that runs our business.’ Presenting the committee opinion for the Ministry of Education Science and Technology’s budget estimates and expenditures, the Committee’s Chairman, Peter Serukamba, said shortage of teachers and other officials in the education sector was disturbing. “In our duties as a watchdog committee we found that almost in all units that we visited as part of inspecting development projects, there is a serious shortage of workforce. We suggest the government issues urgent necessary employment permits to help curb the employment gap,” he said. The most affected institutions include the Nelson Mandela Institute of Science and Technology, Moshi Cooperative University and Arusha Technical College. Already the government through the Minister of State President’s Office (Public Service Management and Good Governance) Captain (rtd), George Mkuchika has announced that it plans to hire over 44,000 staff in the 2 02 0/2 02 1 financial year and that will include 13 ,5 2 9 employees for the education sector. Other openings according to the minister will include some 10,46 7 positions in the health sector and 2,145 in the agriculture, fisheries and livestock areas. However, Mr Serukamba in the National Assembly urged the committee to also call upon the government to establish Presidential Scholarship Awards that will recognise the best performing High Secondary School students and sponsor their university education in any world reputable institution.
