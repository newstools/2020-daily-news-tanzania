BIHARAMULO District Commissioner (DC) Saada Malundo has banned children under 18 years to engage in petty businesses as a preventive measure against the spread of coronavirus. She also directed parents to ensure schoolchildren who were at home after the closure of schools avoid loitering. “I have received reports that some of the schoolchildren are engaging in petty businesses at local markets while several teachers give tuition lessons at unregistered centres contrary to government directives. The children should remain at home as a preventive measure. We should not relax because the pandemic is a global emergency,” she said. She appealed to people to wash their hands regularly with soap, use hand sanitiser and cover their nose and mouth with a disposable tissue or flexed elbow when they coughed or sneezed. People should also avoid close contact (1 metre or 3 feet) with people who are unwell and stay home and self-isolate from others in the household if one feels unwell. Kagera Region recorded its first suspected coronavirus patient a few weeks ago who was reported to have entered the country through Kabanga Entry Point in Ngara District from a neighbouring country. The patient was later confirmed to have contracted the disease and sent to an isolation centre. The government has ramped up its call for preventive measures such as general hygienic practices, including the use of facemasks, handwashing and use of sanitisers in public places and increased enforcement of social distancing. Coronavirus spreads primarily through contact with an infected person when they cough or sneeze. It also spreads when a person touches a surface or object that has the virus on it, then touches their eyes, nose or mouth.
