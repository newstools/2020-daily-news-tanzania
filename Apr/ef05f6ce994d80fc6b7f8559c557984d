Stock Market DESPITE a significant drop in activities, the Tanzania Share Index (TSI) edged up by 16.89 points to close the week at 3,494.15 points. This results from a 0.49 per cent appreciation of the domestic market capitalisation at the end of the week of 9.17tri/-(3.99 billion US dollars). The domestic market cap was propped up by appreciation of prices on CRDB, DSE and TPCC. CRDB doubled as the top gainer and top mover for the week under review. CRDB gained 7.14 per cent to close the week at a price of 150/-compared to 140/-during the previous week. This followed a movement of 0.83 million shares to realize a turnover of 124.49m/- (0.05 million US dollars), thus accounting for 69.7 per cent of the total realized turnover during the week. CRDB has been climbing since the dividend announcement of 17/-per share. At the current price, the dividend yield for the bank stands at 11.33 per cent. Appreciation on TPCC and DSE follows outstanding results released during the past two weeks. Twiga saw an increase in profits by 5.7 per cent for the FY2019. DSE released results for the first quarter of 2020 and quarterly profits grew by 38.5 per cent mostly due to a substantial growth of transactions during January and February, and subdued overhead expenses. The price of Twiga grew by 4.76 percent to 2,200/-while DSE grew by 1.12 percent to 900/-. The total equity turnover during the week went down by 80 per cent as a result of lower activities on the CRDB counter. The total turnover during the week was 178.7m/-(0.08 million US dollars) from a volume of 0.85mln shares. CRDB accounted for 97.3 per cent of the total volume of shares moved. The All Share Index (DSEI) was on the green as well, seen with its recent recovery trend. The DSEI gained 8.62 points to close the week at 1,766.73 points. The total market capitalisation gained 0.49 per cent similar to the domestic market cap. The total cap closed the week at 14.66tri/-(6.37 billion US dollars). On top of appreciated domestic counters, only KCB Bank appreciated by 2.63 per cent on the cross listed counters’ list. The weight of KCB was enough to counteract the effect of depreciated counters during the week. Kenya Airways dropped by 20 per cent, reasonably, as most flights are halted as a measure to curb Covid-19. NMG dropped by 3.85 per cent while all other cross listed counters remained stagnant. Foreign investors were missing in action for a fourth week in a row as domestic investors dominated the market by 100 per cent on both sides. Most foreign investors are seeking safe havens in gold and Treasuries in developed markets. We may experience the existing scenario for some time even after the end of the Covid-19 crisis as investors shall be attracted to regional cheap stocks compared to the overvalued stocks on DSE. The correlation of foreign participation and activities on the TBL counter yet pertains as TBL recorded zero transactions during the week. TBL is usually responsible for more than three quarters of market activities. The lifelessness on the counter stands to affect business of most market stakeholders in the long term. Market, Bills and Bonds Volume traded on the Interbank Money Market (IMM) rose for the first time in six weeks. The amount traded rose by 172 per cent to a total of 56.5bn/-(24.5 million US dollars) compared to 20.8bn/-(9.04 million US dollars) traded during the previous week. The weighted average interbank rate gained 32bps during the week to 4.82 per cent. Investors’ appetite on the most paying government paper, the 20 year Treasury bond, slowed down during the auction held on 22nd April 2020. The Bank of Tanzania offered the usual 117bn/- (50.8 million US dollars) and the public tendered a total of 276.86bn/-(120.24 million US dollars) from 440 bids. The previous 20 years auction during February 2020, with a similar offer, the Bank received 566 bids worth 450.87bn/-(195.8 million US dollars). The weighted average yield to maturity (WAYTM), lost 44.4bps to 15.8537 per cent. Although the Bank had an opportunity to lower the yield further than it did, the Bank opted not to, by accepting more than what the Bank offered. Successful amount totaled to 170bn/-(73.83 million US dollars) from 331 bids, somewhat 45 per cent above the offer size. During the previous auction, the Bank accepted 3 percent less of the offer size from 208 bids. The Bank of Tanzania seems comfortable with current yields and interest rates as seen in the last three Treasury auctions where the Bank accepted more than the Bank offered, thus supporting Treasury yields. The Bank achieves two main objectives with the move. One; The Bank secures increased funds to cover government’s budgetary expenses while revenue sources for the government are stressed by the fear of the coronavirus. Two; the bank provides a safe haven with sufficient return for public’s funds as investment opportunities are increasingly frazzled by the ongoing corona crisis. Currency Market The shilling is still on a daily consecutive depreciation for a sixth week in a row. The shilling lost 61 pips to close the week under review at a weighted average exchange rate of TZS 2,302.67/ USD. Value of transactions on the Interbank Foreign Exchange Market (IFEM) have risen for four straight weeks. It is possibly the central bank’s injection of foreign currency into the banking system to support the shilling. This shall be obvious in a monthly report for May by the Bank of Tanzania. The value of transactions during the week was $8.9mln compared to $6.8 during the previous week.
