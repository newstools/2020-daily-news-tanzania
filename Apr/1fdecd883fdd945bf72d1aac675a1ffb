The government has lauded Huawei for its contribution to the country’s efforts to fight against the spread of coronavirus. Prime Minister Kassim Majaliwa made the remarks after receiving Huawei’s ICT and technology donations in Dodoma today. These include video conferencing systems and thermal imaging temperature monitoring systems. Prime Minister Majaliwa thanked Huawei and said the government appreciated the tech company’s donations which would assist their efforts in combating the infectious disease, which has affected 24 people in Tanzania, 5 of whom have recovered. Most of these digital facilities will be installed in Ministry of Health and a designated hospital for Covid-19 patients, to enable efficient communication between the Ministry headquarters and the hospital. Frank Zhou, the CEO of Huawei Tanzania, said as a localized company operating in Tanzania for over a decade, Huawei was called upon to assist the country in the fight. “It is our obligation rather than an option to make our unique contribution, as a part of Tanzania in the face of the current outbreak. That is why we combine our technological capabilities to support the Tanzanian government to confront the disease. We believe technologies could further enhance the efficiency of communication and data exchange required in this battle,” said Zhou. In addition to the donation, Huawei Tanzania is actively working with operators in ensuring the stability of telecommunication network, which is critical infrastructure at this time, to keep vital health, education and emergency services online, businesses running, and friends and families connected. Huawei Tanzania is also enabling ICT students of College of Information and Communication Technologies (CoICT) of University of Dar es Salaam (UDSM) and Dar es Salaam Institute of Technology (DIT) to continue learning online through Huawei’s smart education platform after the university closed down due to the virus.
