BUKOBA Catholic Auxiliary Bishop Methodius Kilaini has urged Tanzanians to join forces in fighting COVID-19 by praying to God while continuing to take precautionary measures against the disease. Bishop Kilaini made the call during Good Friday service, whereby Roman Catholic worshipers skipped the traditional kissing of the Holy Cross as a precaution against its spread. “As the government intensifies efforts to curb the coronavirus, all necessary measures must be taken. Religious institutions should join hands in praying to Almighty God to save us from this pandemic. People should continue washing their hands using soap and avoid gatherings,” he told worshippers at the Mater Misericordiae Cathedral in Bukoba Municipality. Meanwhile, Bukoba District Commissioner Deodatus Kinawiro has directed the Bukoba Municipal Director, Morrice Limbe, to ensure that taxis are decontaminated as a precaution against coronavirus. He also directed drivers of mini-buses to relocate to Rumuli area adjacent to Bukoba central police station to ease congestion at the Bukoba main bus stand. Kagera Region recorded its first suspected coronavirus patient a few weeks ago who was later confirmed to have contracted the disease and was immediately sent to an isolation centre. The patient, a truck driver, entered the country through Kabanga Entry Point in Ngara District. In a separate development, retired Bishop Dr Samson Mushemba of the North- Western Diocese under the Evangelical Lutheran Church (NWD-ELCT) died on Thursday night while receiving medical treatment at Ndolage hospital in Kamachumu in Muleba District, Bishop Dr Abednego Keshomshahara of the NWD described the deceased as a dedicated leader who spent most of his life serving the people. “The diocese is mourning the passing of a dedicated leader. He will forever live in our hearts. May he rest in peace,” he said. According to Bishop Keshomshahara, burial arrangements were being made and more details would be released later.
