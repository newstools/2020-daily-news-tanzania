THE government has released a total of 240 million shillings to Chalinze District Council in Coast Region to be spent on completing construction of science laboratories in eight secondary schools in the district. The district’s Deputy Secondary Education Officer, Ms Irene Joseph, told a delegation of the district’s Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM), Secretariat during a recent tour to inspect ongoing construction activities at Kwamkomba Secondary School in Miono Ward that each school has been given a total of 30 million shillings for the purpose. “We thank our government for providing our schools with this sum of money which has been allocated in the 2020/2021 financial budget,” she said, adding that completion of the laboratories will enable the students understand science subjects more effectively through doing practicals. For his part, CCM Chairman for Chalinze District, Abdul Sharifu said that the Party would continue to work closely with the government in improving the learning environment in its schools. Meanwhile, shortage of water which was facing 320 students at a new school, Mapinga Secondary School in Bagamoyo District, has finally been solved after an institution known as It’s Time to Help in collaboration with Feza Schools Tanzania constructed a borehole worth 12 million shillings for the school. Speaking during a brief handing over ceremony recently, the School’s Headmistress, Ms Agnes Mmbaga, told the Public Relations Officer for the It’s Time to Help Organisation, Mr Mbwana Kitendo that the students will now be able to study with no difficulties after having the water supply service. “Our school is still new and we started to receive our first Form One students in January this year. We still have lot of challenges like shortage of classrooms, we have no electricity, we need to fence for our school and many others. I am inviting other stakeholders who are ready to work with us to solve these challenges,” she said.
