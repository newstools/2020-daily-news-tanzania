AIRTEL Tanzania has launched an Airtel Money customer drive campaign where one gets free minutes every time they do a transaction. The campaign works after conducting any transaction on Airtel Money, including sending money, cashing out, paying bills or buying bundles and airtime. Airtel Tanzania Director of Airtel Money Services, Isack Nchunda said they decided to launch the ‘transact and get free talk time’ offer to reward customers across the country for their loyalty in using Airtel Money services. “This offer aims to sensitize all mobile money customers to make use of Airtel Money services while paying for various goods and services to meet their daily needs,” Mr Nchunda said yesterday. Airtel Money has more than 5.0 million customers, over 100,000 thousand Airtel agents and over 1,500 Airtel Money branches countrywide. The campaign also aims to influence adoption of digital payment lifestyle in the country instead of depending on cash payment mode that is not secure and reliable. Speaking at the same event, Airtel Tanzania Director of Communications, Beatrice Singano said Airtel prides itself for having a vast mobile money agent network in the country. “We are keen to continue supporting government initiatives in making financial inclusion a reality by offering reliable, affordable and secured products and services, while at the same time rewarding our customers for using our Airtel Money Services,” said Ms Singano
