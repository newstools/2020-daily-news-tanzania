YOU can now make payments to over 600 government agencies through UBA Bank Tanzania, thanks to the lender’s integration into the Government e-Payment Gateway (GePG). UBA Bank said on Tuesday that its system has been successfully integrated into the GePG, allowing Tanzanians to effectively make all government payments-tax and non-tax revenue-at any of UBA Tanzania’s branches. Specifically, UBA Tanzania was one of the eight banks in the country that were certified by Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA) to start collecting government tax revenue through the GePG Platform from July 1, 2020 as the Authority transits from the use of Tax bank to GePG. The UBA Tanzania’s Head of Public Sector, Mr Dominick Timothy, said the integration of the bank’s system into the GePG was one of the ways that the pan-African lender was supporting the government’s development initiatives. Mr Timothy noted that following the successful completion of the GePG integration for tax and non tax government revenue payment at all our branches. The bank will also be integrating the platform into its multiple digital banking channels like mobile app, internet banking, Leo chatbot, USSD Magic Banking and Webcollect with a view to improving the ease with which members of the public can pay their tax and non-tax bills through UBA from the convenience of their homes and offices. “It has always been our aspiration to support government initiatives of which efficient means of revenue collection through the unique digital expertise of the bank are a key component. We are glad and grateful to TRA and Ministry of Finance for providing us this opportunity to be of service to the nation” he said.
