Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta has announced a phased reopening of the country amid a rising number of coronavirus infections. The president lifted travel restrictions in and out of Nairobi, Mombasa and Mandera counties, which are some of the regions with the highest coronavirus cases. However, the 2100 to 0400 nationwide curfew remains in place for a further 30 days. Places of worship will reopen, with a maximum of 100 participants allowed in a service, which should not last longer than an hour. The president also announced the resumption of local flights from 15 July. International flights may resume from 1 August with strict Covid-19 protocols expected to be followed. The president said the country would revert to a lockdown if infection rates worsen. He urged Kenyans to "exercise shared responsibility" in the fight against the pandemic. Kenya has recorded 7,886 cases of Covid-19, including 160 deaths.
