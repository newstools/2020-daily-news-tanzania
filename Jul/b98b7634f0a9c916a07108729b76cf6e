MWANZA based Alliance FC Head Coach Kessy Mziray was left fuming after his charges dropped points in a 1-1 draw with Mtibwa Sugar in the Mainland Premier League match at Nyamagana Stadium here on Wednesday. Alliance went ahead after just a minute from kick off through an own goal by Henry Joseph but Salum Kihimbwa equalised for Mtibwa Sugar in the 78th minute. Speaking after the match, Mziray said his players didn’t perform well and failed to execute their duties, especially in the second half. “They (players) failed to follow the technical bench instructions, something that led us to drop crucial points in battle to survive relegation,” he lamented. He added that his team created a host of scoring chances, but managed to utilise only one of them. Mziray said their game plan was scoring a goal in the first half something, which they succeeded and shut out their opponent in the second stanza, which they failed. He further said they will work hard to make sure they win their Thursday’s matches against Lipuli FC at Nyamagana Stadium. Alliance FC are still languishing in the relegation zone, whereby they are placed 16th on the log after gathering 37 points from 33 outings. They have won nine, drawn ten and lost 14 matches. On his side, Mtibwa Sugar Head Coach, Zuberi Katwila said both teams played well but their opponents dominated the game in the first half. He added they expected a difficult match something which occurred. Katwila is determined to make sure Mtibwa Sugar survives the cutoff point. He has switched focus on their next match against Mbao FC at CCM Kirumba Stadium tomorrow.
