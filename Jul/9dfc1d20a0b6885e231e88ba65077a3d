DEPUTY Minister for Livestock and Fisheries Development, Abdallah Ulega has urged countries bordering Lake Victoria to intensify the fight against illegal fishing to ensure such resources are protected. He offered the call here yesterday during a brief teleconference meeting with ministers from Uganda, Kenya and Burundi, insisting that the efforts must be sustained to safeguard the endangered species. Fishing sector contributes potentially to the economy, he said. At least 60 per cent of the net income is generated from the Lake Victoria activities, creating employment, improving food security and trade between regions. “We have been exporting fish fillet from Mwanza to Europe, meaning we must protect these resources at all cost,” he said. Initially, he said the government resolved to revamp the Lake Victoria Fisheries Organization to improve its watchdog role in the country’s largest freshwater body. He said the organization is vital for sustaining the fishing sector amongst the lake region, and also vital in the country’s gross domestic product and the people’s livelihood. Tanzania holds the largest part of the lake compared with other countries. The deputy minister said such advantage must help Tanzanians benefit from the lake socially and economically. Already there are more than 200,000 fishermen who ply through the mighty lake benefiting more than 4 million others in the long value chain. He announced that the government is fully committed to ensuring that more people benefit from the sector. “This plan is to ensure that the fishing sector not only benefits the current generation, but many more others to come. We must forge forces and involve the communities who are the prime watchmen of the resources,” he added. The meeting which involved other ministers expected to bring about solid changes in the sector and contribute more in fostering development across the region.
