AFTER progressing into the Azam Sports Federation Cup (ASFC), semifinals, Namungo FC remains confident that they will go all the way to the finals of the contest. Namungo were the first team to venture into the last four on Tuesday after brushing aside Alliance FC 2-0 in a quarterfinals battle staged at the Majaliwa Stadium in Ruangwa, Lindi. Namungo netted their goals through Bigirimana Blaise, who scored via a controversial penalty, while the second goal was pumped in by George Makana with a stunning bicycle kick strike, which left Alliance goalie Kelvin Richard helpless in between the poles. Speaking after the match, Namungo Coach Thiery Hitimana said reaching into the last four was their number one priority. “We prepared well to win this game and had good opportunities to score more goals but I am satisfied with what we have produced. “They came with defensive and time wasting tactics but we responded back positively by ensuring that we do not lose the game,” Hitimana said. On his part, Alliance Assistant Coach Daddy Gilbert said fatigue among his charges was the main reason behind the team's poor performance. “It is a bad luck for us because we wanted to win the match and make it into the semi-finals but that has not happened,” he said. He added that they arrived in Ruangwa in the morning of the match (Tuesday) after playing their top flight league match against Coastal Union in Tanga last Saturday. “We started the trip on Saturday but on the way, we had a breakdown as such, we waited to hire another vehicle to drive us here hence we arrived this morning and in such scenario, it becomes a miracle to win,” he said. He continued: “We never had time to do recovery after the long travel but I do not blame anybody for this, it was just the circumstances surrounding the whole thing which could not give us time to do well.”
