CONSUMERS of insurance and beneficiaries who find themselves in disagreement with insurance service providers have been advised to refer their concerns to the Tanzania Insurance Ombudsman Service (TIO). The TIO was established under section 122 of the Insurance Act, No.10 of 2009 with the mandate of resolving insurance disputes between insurance companies and insurance consumers or beneficiaries. It resolves insurance disputes in a timely and cost-effective manner as an alternative to normal Court litigation procedures, when it started its operations in 2015 after the appointment of the Ombudsman. Speaking to 'Daily News' at the ongoingÂ  44th Dar es Salaam International Trade Fair (DITF), the TIO Senior Arbitrator, Mr Aderickson Njunwa said that the methods of insurance dispute resolutions include reconciliation, mediation, and arbitration. "The nature of disputes can be referred to TIO include one where the insurer has rejected your claim or where you do not agree with the amount of offer for compensation," he said. He added, "Other disputes are when there is a delay responding to your claim and without reasons from the insurer and where there is a disagreement in the interpretation of insurance contract," Mr Njunwa said that in order for TIO to deal with the complaint, the complainant must show that he or she is a victim who is aggrieved by the insurer's decision regarding his claim. The nature of complaints which may lead to disputes, he said includes low rates of compensation, delay to process and pay admitted claims as well as unjustified repudiation of claims. According to him, a complaint may be filed in writing either by email, fax, or letter of complaint. It can also be filed orally by appearing before the Registrar of Complaints who will reduce the same into writing. The Arbitrator said that a complaint may be filed within three years from the time the complainant becomes aware that he has a reason to complain to the Insurance ombudsman.
