ZEC Director, Mr Thabit Idarous Faina said over 50 per cent of the target was met in the two-day exercise (one day in Pemba and one in Unguja), and that those who missed the cards at the distribution centres should find their cards at the ZEC district offices. Each person is required to present the old or expiring voter card for the new one, the director said, and those who had lost their cards are required to pay 5,000/- fine. “Preparations for the elections have been going on well, and today we will release the official date for the polls, the expected number of voters, and other logistics,” Faina informed journalists at his office. The National Election Commission (NEC) which manages union elections (councillors in the mainland, MPs, and union president) has set October 28 this year as the Election Day as political parties finalize nomination processes of their candidates. President of Zanzibar, House of Representatives (HoR), and Isles local councillors are under ZEC’s jurisdiction, while election of the President of the United Republic of Tanzania is under National Election Commission. This will be the sixth general election since the re-introduction of multiparty democracy in the country in 1992. Meanwhile, 26 organizations which applied for voter education and observation are being screened before granting permission, Mr Faina added.
