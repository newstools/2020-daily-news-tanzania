ALIYU Dauda, the first accused in a murder case facing three people, told Judge Sam Rumanyika that he was kidnapped and tortured by unknown people who later arraigned him. He also told the court that to date he didn’t know any charge he was facing. Judge Rumanyika asked: “Regarding those unknown people, who allegedly kidnapped you, where did they take you to?” Dauda: “Before this honourable court.” Prosecuting State Attorney Juma Mahona told the court during preliminary hearing that on the night of July 18, 2015 the three accused - Dauda, Rashid Mzee and Ngesela Keya alias Ismail murdered Stachius Severin from Kalonge Village in Bukoba Rural District. He told the court that the prosecution intended to call 10 witnesses to establish the murder case facing the accused. Judge Rumanyika explained that the hearing date of the criminal case No 25/2019 would be fixed by the Deputy Registrar and ordered the accused to be remanded still. Meanwhile, three court assessors  in a murder case No 100/2016 facing Suleiman Juma Kasumuni  told Judge Rumanyika that in their opinion the prosecution did not prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt. The assessors – Mr Augustine Mutayoba, Ms Joyce Kagaruki and Mr Apolinary Bulengela - gave their opinion after Judge Rumanyika summed up the evidence. According to Judge Rumanyika, the prosecution depended solely on a cautioned statement made by the accused before the police, but there was no direct or circumstantial evidence. However, he noted that it was mandatory for the cautioned statement to be collaborated by other evidence. Prosecuting State Attorney Suzan Masule told the court that on February 2, 2015, the accused murdered Kasumuni Samuel.
