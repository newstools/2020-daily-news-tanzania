DAR ES SALAAM Stock Exchange (DSE) has managed to double its net profit in this year’s quarter two, despite Covid-19 challenges thanks to increase appetite of government securities. The exchange profit jumped to 668.8m/- in Q2 this year from 390.06m/- of previous quarter last year. Orbit Securities said in its weekly market synopsis that the exchange fundamentals are still very solid with a very healthy balance sheet which encourages growth in investment income. “Listing fees, mostly from Treasury bonds, is still growing strong, especially as the government encourages longer term securities, and an increased appetite of Treasury securities from the public,” Orbit report said. Total revenue climbed to 1.81bn/- from 1.36bn/- pushed up mainly by listing fees. The listing fees increased from 608.16m/- in Q2 last year to 835.54m/- Q2 this year. Also investment fees increased from 446.45m/- to 589.74m/-. On other hand, transaction fees went down to 144.04m/- from 177.34m/-. However, on quarter to quarter basis the operating margin dropped from 42.56 per cent during Q1 this year to 36.85 per cent during Q2 as a result of a 10.2 per cent decline in the total revenue while expenses grew marginally by 1.3 per cent. The drop in revenue in Q2 was the result of a 62.4 per cent decline in transactions fees and 31 per cent decline in CSD fees, caused by slower market activities in the period of intense Covid-19 cases globally. In the first half this year, the bourse managed to grow its underlying revenue by 51 per cent in the first six months of this year despite Covid- 19 challenges. Despite the challenge of Covid- 19, conveniently, total expenses only grew by 17.5 per cent, which pushed up the operating margin to almost 40 per cent compared to 22.65 per cent for the first six months of last year
