THE Minister of State in the Prime Minister’s Office (Investment), Mr Angellah Kairuki, has commended Hai-based Harsho Group of companies for embarking on manufacturing Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). Minister Kairuki made the remark during her tour of the company, saying the development was timely as Tanzania and other countries in the world are fighting the Covid-19 pandemic. “Your decision to embark on production of PPE has contributed a lot in battling the pandemic because it reduces the country’s dependency on imported equipment especially now when most countries are in lockdown,” she said. She explained that Harsho Group had demonstrated its patriotism and readiness to support the government in various issues related to the country’s development. “This is not the first time I am hearing about the company’s involvement in national issues; it was also in the news when the government banned the use of plastic bags because it also embarked on producing eco-friendly packaging materials,”, she remarked. Minister Kairuki also hailed the company for investing in various areas which had contributed to job creation, a move which she said improved the economic well-being of many people. Earlier, the company’s Director, Mr Harold Shoo, told the minister that the company embarked on the production of PPEs as part of its contribution to the government’s efforts to fight the Covid-19 pandemic. Mr Shoo said the company had also embarked on manufacturing animal feed.
