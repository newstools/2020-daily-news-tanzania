THE Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries, through the National Ranching Company (NARCO), has released 20,000 hectares to be used as pasture by villagers surrounding Ruvu Ranch in Bagamoyo District in Coast Region. The decision seeks to resolve conflicts between pastoralists and farmers and increase meat production. Deputy Minister for Livestock and Fisheries Mr Abdallah Ulega announced the decision in Fukayosi and Mkenge villages in the district on Thursday during his one day tour. He said the 20, 000 hectares will be divided into plots to enable pastoralists feed their animals smoothly. " The government has started to work in this project in other parts of the country as well, the aim being to eliminate conflicts between the two groups which are creating tensions in the communities", he said. The deputy minister said the project would help to end the trend of pastoralists feeding their animals near the area owned by Ruvu Ranch. NARCO's Acting General Manager, Mr Masele Mipawa, said that the processes for the project were in the final stages and were projected for completion by 15th July, 2020. Mr Masele also said later during an interview that, the pastoralists will be paying for the service according to the size of the plot that each one of them would be using. In both villages, Mr Ulega who was accompanied by District Commissioner Ms Zainab Kawawa, District Executive Director (DED) Ms Fatuma Latu, outgoing Member of Parliament for Bagamoyo Constituent Dr Shukuru Kawambwa and the district's Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) leaders stressed the importance of pastoralists and farmers respecting each other and co-existing harmoniously. For her part, District Commissioner Zainab Kawawa thanked the government for the step, saying it would be very helpful in resolving conflicts between pastoralists and farmers.
