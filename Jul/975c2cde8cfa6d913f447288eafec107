THE fifth phase government has injected over 2bn/- into development projects in Tarime Town Council in recent months. Tarime Town Council Director Elias Ntiruhungwa said this during a press briefing in his office early this week. “We are lucky to receive at least 2.1bn/- from the fifth phase government for the construction of various projects,” Mr Ntiruhungwa said. He said about 1bn/- would be spent on the rehabilitation of several buildings, water and power infrastructure at Tarime Secondary School. The old and famous public secondary school that used to receive students from various parts of the country has not been rehabilitated for decades. “This school has never received money and we thank President John Magufuli for giving us 968m- for the rehabilitation of the school,” the town council director said. He noted that the money would, among other things, be spent on the rehabilitation of dormitories, classrooms, teachers’ houses and on tap water and power network. Mr Ntiruhungwa also said his council had received 397m/- for the improvement of learning facilities in a number of secondary and primary schools. “At least 397m/- will be spent on additional classrooms, latrines and desks.” At the same time the council has received 250m/- for the improvement of road network in the fast-growing town. Some roads will be upgraded to tarmac level, according to Mr Ntiruhungwa. On the health sector, he said 400m/- had been made available for the construction of staff houses and the improvement of water supply and other services at the town council’s largest hospital.
