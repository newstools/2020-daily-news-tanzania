STAGE has set for the High School boys to display their skills in the basketball tournament at Bball Kitaa courts in Dar es Salaam today. The day-long 3x3-a-side tournament will be staged at courts located near Indian Ocean in Dar es Salaam. Organised by Unmatched Basketball in collaboration with Robman Sports for all of Dar es Salaam, the tournament is open for teams of school boys aged between 15 and 19 years. Robert Manyerere, one of the tournament’s organisers, told the ‘Daily News on Saturday’ in Dar es Salaam yesterday that preparation for the one-day tournament has been finalised and that they are expected to see over eight teams battling it out for the top honours. Manyerere, however, said only four of them had already confirmed their participation by yesterday afternoon as others are expected to join before the tournament starts. He named the teams that confirmed participation as UBA Boys, Ally PG, Masaki and Mchenga Boys. The best performers of the tournament will be awarded medals and cash prizes. Manyerere, who also serves as youth basketball coach, said that this kind of the event was last held at the Jakaya Mrisho Kikwete (JMK) Youth Park grounds in the city last year, and Ally PG, who won the last event, will be there to defend their title.
