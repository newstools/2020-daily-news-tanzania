NMB Bank on Sunday donated building materials and other goods worth 36m/-to different schools and a health centre in Kinondoni District, Dar es Salaam. Receiving the donation, Kinondoni District Commissioner (DC), Daniel Chongolo said the bank had donated 180 iron sheets, 200 desks, six sanitising machines, 100 chairs and their tables for Oysterbay, Msasani, Tandale Magharibi, Mzimuni Primary Schools as well as Kisauke and Turiani secondary schools. On the list he included beds and mattresses for Mabwepande Health Centre. The function was held at Turiani Secondary School grounds. Expounding, the DC thanked the bank for support, noting that it motivated and mobilised teachers, pupils and members of the community to encourage students to study hard. NMB Acting Zone Branch Manager, Seka Urio said addressing education and health challenges was one of their priorities. “Although the government is doing a lot, as stakeholders we are also responsible for supporting the government to bring about social development,” he said. Mr Urio noted that when the bank was requested to help, they immediately consulted school heads to highlight their changes and see where they needed support. “With this, NMB Bank teamed up with the schools, where each was allocated 50 desks and chairs. Equally, we helped Mzimuni Primary School with 150 iron sheets and the remaining got sanitisers and water tanks in efforts to fight Covid-19. We also donated beds and mattresses to Mabwepande Health Centre although we are still getting a lot of requests to help in community projects. The bank is focusing on education, health and calamities, whenever they occur and help,” he pointed out. He further said this year, the bank had set aside over 1bn/-for community development, especially in health and education sectors.
