Tanzania Social Action Fund (TASAF) is now implementing President John Magufuli’s directive on verification of its books containing a list of beneficiaries of the ambitious project targeting poor families. Early this week, TASAF experts were in Tarime to provide special training to officials tasked to conduct the verification exercise. Speaking during the opening of the training for Tarime Town Council officials, Ms Nisalile Brown Mwaipasi from TASAF said the exercise is being done to implement the directive issued by President Magufuli during the launch of the second round of TASAF phase III. The President urged TASAF to carry out the verification exercise to omit all households that do not have criteria to benefit from the programme prior to the implementation of the second round, she said. “In order to implement the President’s directive, we will start implementing verification of our book for the targeted beneficiaries.” Ms Mwaipasi said in her opening remarks which she read on behalf of the TASAF Executive Director, Mr Ladislaus Mwamanga. She urged the officials entrusted to conduct the exercise to come up with a clean list of poor households entitled to benefit from the programme. According to her, empowering households that will be registered to engage in income-generating activities and improvement of social services especially on education and health sectors will be given top priority during the second round of TASAF phase III. Earlier, Tarime Town Council Director, Mr Elias Ntiruhungwa warned facilitators in his council to be careful during the verification exercise. “This is a national exercise that needs much attention. You have been entrusted and you have to prove that you can deliver “, Mr Ntiruhungwa said. The verification exercise is expected to take a few days, according to the officials. Implementation of the first round of TASAF III shows achievement in complementing efforts by the government to reduce poverty in the country, Ms Mwaipasi said.
