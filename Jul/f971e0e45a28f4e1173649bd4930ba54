 TAIFA Stars skipper Mbwana Samatta has given kudos to all those who prayed for him and his Aston Villa to remain in the English Premier League (EPL), next season after surviving relegation. Aston Villa were held to a 1-1 draw by hosts West Ham on Sunday on the final day of last season’s EPL which enabled Villa to claim 17th place with 35 points, only one point above relegated Bournemouth who were dropped with 34 points. Other two EPL sides which have been relegated to the championship are Watford which ended the last season on 19th slot with 34 points as well as Norwich City who finished bottom on the 20-team table with 21 points. It was Villa who netted first on the day via Jack Grealish but his strike was cancelled a minute later to bring back nervous moment for the visitors. However, writing on his Instagram page after the match, Samatta said: “I return my appreciation to God for deciding that I should remain in the EPL next season. “Thank you for wishing well Aston Villa so that you should continue seeing me in this lovely league,” wrote Samatta. On the other hand, two teams whose promotion into the EPL next season have been confirmed are Leeds United which get back in the elite competition after 16 years of absence and West Bromwich Albion who returns after two years playing in the championship. Villa were one of the first teams to play when the Premier League resumed following a three-month suspension caused by the coronavirus pandemic, with a 0-0 home draw against Sheffield United leaving them in the bottom three. As recently as 12 July, they were seven points adrift of 17th place, but their first four-game unbeaten run of the season saw them to safety, with the point at West Ham one of eight they earned in that time. However, one player whose future at Villa will inevitably be discussed in the media this summer is Jack Grealish, who scored their goal at West Ham on Sunday and has been their standout performer during their last campaign.
