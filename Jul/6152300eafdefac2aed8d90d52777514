MINISTER for Energy, Dr Medard Kalemani, has directed Tanesco to supply an alternative transformer to Biharamulo District. He gave the directive this week when he visited Biharamulo Stamigold Company and said Rusabya and Kabukome villages should get electricity as soon as possible. “Villagers were complaining about delays in connecting their houses to electricity. Tanesco must ensure this issue is addressed as soon as possible by installing an alternative transformer in their area,” he said. He noted that Kagera residents should utilise the opportunity by setting up industries in line with the government’s industrialisation by 2025. Biharamulo District Tanesco Manager Ernest Milyango informed Dr Kalemani that unknown people who posed as Tanesco workers disconnected a former transformer and made away with it. However, people became suspicious and tipped Tanesco officials and the police, which led to the arrest of several people in connection with the incident. Kagera Regional Police Commander (RPC) Revocatus Malimi confirmed that two people had been held in connection with the theft of the transformer.
