PARENTS and guardians in Ikungi and Manyoni districts have been advised to abandon the myth that mixed nutrient supplements are harmful to children. The call was made by the Tanzania Food and Nutrition Centre (TFNC) Director of Nutrition and Education Ms Sikitu Kahingu, during a training session for health care providers on the use of mixed nutrients supplements that are given to the children in the 6-23 months’ age group. She said nutrients supplements play a key role in helping a child's development in fighting nutrition deficiencies. She said the supplements help children to cope with obesity and malnutrition. According to her, in many communities, some parents are unable to prepare a diet that meets all nutritional needs for a child. Ms Kahungi noted that Ikungi and Manyoni councils were in the process of implementing mixed nutrients supplements for children aged 6 to 23 months under the sponsorship of Nutrition International and coordinated by World Vision. "Until March this year, a total of 16,416 children have been reached and benefited from the services," she said. On her part, a nurse from Kitinku Health Centre, Ms Neema Eliasi, one of the participants in the training session, remarked: "Many mothers do not have enough knowledge on the importance of mixed supplements and expose children to the risk of becoming malnourished.” Nutritional supplements are any dietary supplements that are intended to provide nutrients that may otherwise not be consumed in sufficient quantities.
