NATIONAL swimming Coach, Michael Livingstone, believes his youngsters will quickly return to their quality after four months of suspension due to Covid-19. To make sure the youngsters regain their shape, the Tanzania Swimming Association (TSA), together with the national team coaches; brought swimmers from all clubs in the country at Champions Rise Swimming Pool owned by Shaaban Robert Secondary School and began training last weekend. According to coach, Livingstone, who is part of the coaching team at the camp, swimmers are responding well to training regimes He said they are training six days a week--from Monday to Saturday where they begin at 7 am sharp. “The kids were super excited after being told that swimming resumes. They came early and they have been attentive and impressive in their return. However, they are not fit yet after a long period out of the pool.” “For now we are working on general and body fitness training. Then, we shall work on the swimming technics and skills, the basic aerobic and then after we will proceed with other programmes on schedule,” he said.
