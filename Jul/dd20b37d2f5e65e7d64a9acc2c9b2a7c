YOUNG Africans Vice-Chairman Fredrick Mwakalebela said he is saddened with recent reports accusing him of conspiracy ahead of their next game against Lipuli FC tomorrow. Yanga, who have been pushed to the third slot on the table surrendered their second place to Azam FC who defeated Mbeya City 1-0 at Azam Complex in Dar es Salaam on Thursday. Both Yanga and Azam have equal points (69) only to be separated by goal difference as the latter have netted 50 goals against 44 scored by the former hence until now, neither of the two teams is assured to end the season as runners up until on the final day tomorrow. “Today (Thursday), I am very saddened and I speak these words with tears coming from my eyes...I have been called many names but I chose to remain quite to bring unity and peace”. “I have been in Iringa since Tuesday to take care of my mother who is sick at Amani Center in Kilole. After that, I returned with my mother to her home and I stayed there throughout yesterday (Wednesday)”. “Today (Thursday) upon reaching in Dar es Salaam, I have heard that some people are saying I booked a hotel in Iringa to be used by Yanga so as to con-spy them on the match day. But, the truth is that the hotel in question has been booked by other officials of the club and I know nothing about it,” said Mwakalebela. He added: “If my services are no longer required, it is better to just let me leave the club freely other than making such false allegations. What powers do I have at Yanga to make such unwelcoming decisions?” he queried. Of late, things have gone astray at Yanga and it all started when the team’s Assistant Coach Boniface Mkwasa and goalkeeper trainer Peter Manyika were excluded from the squad which travelled for away clashes against Mtibwa Sugar and the upcoming Lipuli match. As this was not enough, claims also emerged that the club’s chairman Mshindo Msolla has resigned from his responsibilities which the club and himself declined afterwards.
