TAIFA Stars skipper Mbwana Samatta will be in action tonight as Aston Villa host his dream team Manchester United in the English Premier League (EPL) match at Villa Park in London. It has been a rough ride for Aston Villa this season as they currently sit 18th on the 20-team EPL table with 27 points, only 4 points adrift 17th placed Watford. On the other hand, Manchester United are too looking for triumph so as to consolidate their mission of ending the season on top four to attain the opportunity of playing in the Champions League next season. On form United sit 5th on the log with 55 points and have been enjoying series of victories in most of the fixtures they have lately played and lately, they thrashed Bournemouth 5-2 at Old Trafford. So far, the Tanzanian striker has netted two goals for Aston Villa since he landed at the club from Belgium side Genk and he was introduced from the bench in their recent 2-0 defeat from Liverpool at Anfield. Until now, Aston Villa's Jack Grealish is leading the scoring chart for the team with 9 goals and he is being linked with a possible move to Manchester United next season. However, according to the available statistics, Samatta has never received marching orders in all competitive matches he has so far played in Europe which is a remarkable achievement for him. Aston Villa are winless in their past 10 EPL matches hence they now face must win encounters to be guaranteed of staying put in the league next season. On several occasions, Samatta has been describing Manchester United as his dream club and that he really would like to play for the Red Devils one day. He is therefore going to play to impress against a team he admires a lot so as to win hearts and souls of Manchester United management.
