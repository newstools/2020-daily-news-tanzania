 THE Tanzania Breweries Limited (TBL) has supported barley farmers across northern regions by enabling them to participate in an agricultural fair organised by Tanzania Agricultural Research Institute (TARI). TBL sponsored 100 barley farmers during TARI’s one-day fair held in Arusha at the weekend. The brewer over the years has been collaborating with farmers to improve barley production in the country through providing them with seeds that are best suited to the soil and climatic conditions of the country, as well as a guaranteeing a market for their produce. TBL Agriculture Manager Joel Msechu said the company had sponsored 100 farmers to attend the event to encourage them adopt modern farming practices and technology that would increase productivity. “TBL believes in the power of leveraging partnerships for sustainable development. The Agriculture Fair is, therefore, a networking opportunity for our sorghum and barley farmers which we believe will provide them with requisite knowledge and skills to address some of the challenges they face,” he said. TBL is committed to supporting the government’s industrialisation drive through investing in the development and expansion of a barley programme. The programme includes 6,000 farmers in West Kilimanjaro, Manyara, Arusha, Iringa and Madaba as well as the building of a malting facility in Dodoma that will have the capacity to produce 32,000 tonnes of malt. The company is sourcing 74 per cent of its raw materials locally and is committed to increasing its local sourcing over the coming years.
