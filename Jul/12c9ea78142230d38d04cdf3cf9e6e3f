THE government has banned quack lawyers known as ‘Vishoka’ in Kiswahili from providing legal services to the public at the Law Courts, according to a statement released here yesterday by the Ministry of Legal and Constitutional Affairs. The Ministry’s Deputy Permanent Secretary, Mr Amon Mpanju, noted in a press statement that the government had formalized legal service to protect wananchi against conmen, who use legal service to swindle their money. “We have formalized the legal service to protect wananchi largely women, children and elders against conmen. Quack lawyers are conmen,” said the Permanent Secretary while launching Bukoba District Committee for Coordination of Legal Service Support. In a related move, Mr Mpanju directed the District Committee for Coordination of Legal Service Support to ensure that all 15 legal service unregistered companies, are immediately registered with the government, so long as they meet legal requirements in accordance to the Legal Service Providers Act, 2017. “I issue a two week ultimatum to ensure all unregistered legal service companies in Kagera Region are registered in order to offer legal services legally,” he said. Mr Mpanju explained that legal service and paralegals were vital in addressing frequent disputes in communities without necessarily going to courts, thus help to reduce backlog cases in the courts. Launching of the District Committee for Coordination of Legal Service Support is part of a series of formation of such committees at district level to improve legal service support from lower levels.
