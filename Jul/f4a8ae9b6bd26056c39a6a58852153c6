THE reign of basketball giants faces a big challenge from the fast upcoming trio of DTB, Kurasini Heat and Pazi who now command the run in the Regional Basketball League (RBA). The trio dominated the weekend’s basketball show by beating giants. It was at Bandari Kurasini courts in the city where the teams’ high performances sounded a warning to the basketball giants; JKT, ABC, Oilers, Savio and Vijana City Bulls, the teams that dominated Tanzania basketball for many decades. DTB are doing well after snatching players from the champions Savio. The players include Cornelius Mgaza and Alex Mbwana. Savio also lost Tarimo, Jije Makani, Amini Mtambo and Mohamed Yusuf. Speaking about the new threats, Mohamed Yusuph, who has left Savio and now coaches Mchenga Club, said DTB and Kurasini Heat are new teams that likely to threaten the long reign of the five giants. “They are new sides which are gifted with high skilled players. They are the teams to watch at the moment,” said Yusuf. Owned by DTB Diamond Trust Bank, DTB overpowered giants Oilers with 63-52 win on Sunday before later flooring Chui with hefty 60-29 victory. Kurasini Heat also stamped their basketball authority with 68-48 victory over Ukonga Kings and went to beat Mgulani JKT by 68-48 in their second match later. Pazi, who are running well this season, defeated Magnet 39-16 in their first match and went on beat Vijana ‘City Bulls’ 54-48 in their second match. Polisi, who have landed to the top flight league this season, defeated UDSM Outsider 67-50 in a hotly contested encounter at the same venue. Kurasini Heat are commanding the league table with 4 points and have tied with DTB, Kurasini heat and Pazi with same number of points only average number of goals separates them.
