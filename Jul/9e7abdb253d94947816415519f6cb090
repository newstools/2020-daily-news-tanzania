DRIVERS and other road users who ignore traffic signs will now be slapped with an automatic fine and points on their licence, Minister for Local Government and Regional Administration Mr Haji Omar Kheri has warned. “Police and revenue authorities now have the power to punish, which include fines and imprisonment, to those who drive or park in closed lanes, ignore road traffic signs, and trespass,” Mr Kheri said in a statement. Following the successful installation of CCTV cameras in most areas of the Zanzibar city and other towns, the Minister said the modern cameras will help in identifying law breakers. The cameras were installed during implementation of the ‘safe city’ project. He did not mention the amount of the fines, but the enforcement of the law by using the Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) comes in the wake of increasing road accidents due to reckless driving and disobeying road safety regulations. “The safe city project is going on, as we are committed to keep the city and all areas of Zanzibar safe for all residents, visitors, and road users,” Mr Kheri emphasized as some drivers commented by welcoming the use of CCTV in law enforcement. Mr Omar Ali- a driver in the city said “Let us hope that the CCTV will be used to nab reckless drivers and fine them without asking for bribe. Giving the police the ability to use cameras to catch drivers flouting the law is a necessary next step, we support the move.” Ms Asha Mohamed- a resident and normal pedestrian says majority of road users are supportive of the improvement which aims to curb criminals, including burglars and youths who attack and rob tourists and drivers who violate traffic regulations.” “Normally, we witness drivers ignoring traffics signs, causing accidents, some of which lead to deaths. Reckless driving is another big problem that the CCTV may help to address,” Asha said.
