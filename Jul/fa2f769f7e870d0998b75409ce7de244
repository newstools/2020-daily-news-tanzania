THE outgoing Member of Parliament for the Vunjo constituency here, Mr James Mbatia, stresses that joint efforts by stakeholders are needed to address challenges of lack of reliable hygiene facilities in schools within Kilimanjaro. Mr Mbatia expressed the sentiments recently, during a recent event of handing over a modern hygiene management facility whose construction he sponsored at Iwa Primary school in Kirua Vunjo in Moshi District in Kilimanjaro Region. "One of the challenges facing 144 primary and 74 secondary schools in Kilimanjaro Region is the lack of modern hygiene management facilities; this challenge must be tackled because a good healthy environment, including that of reliable hygiene facilities are vital in enabling students to do well in their studies", said Mr Mbatia in a statement read on his behalf by his personal assistant, Mr Danielson Shayo. "Today we are handing over these modern hygiene management facilities which will comprise of seven toilets with guaranteed water services for male students and the same number for girls. And there would be an extra room for hygiene for adolescent students,” he said. The Iwa Primary School Headmaster, Mr Deogratias Njau, thanked Mr Mbatia for sponsoring the project which he said would benefit a total of 272 students at the school. "This project has eliminated the lack of privacy when students have to grapple with calls of nature,” he said, adding that the school was also lacking adequate hygiene management facilities for teachers, a school kitchen, lack of electricity and aging buildings. Speaking on behalf of parents, Mr. John Assey said that the toilets would eliminate the challenge of the time that students spent on seeking reliable hygiene management facilities.
