The promise was made over the weekend by the agency Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Godfrey Nyaisa, when speaking at his pavilion during the ongoing International Trade Fair at Mwalimu Julius Nyerere grounds Dar es Salaam. Nyaisa said currently they have set good system which enables each staff to be accountable at his working area and requested people who need to start business to visit their pavilion so that they can get information on what to do. “Our existence depends on our customers so we have decided that we must work seriously to satisfy the need of the Tanzanians,” insisted Nyaisa. Either, Nyaisa said Brela have competent youth who collect all questions asked by different people in different social media and submit them  to the experts who find right answers for those customers. He went on that the social media use and online registration have reduced congestion at Brela officers for people who were coming for business registration or those who needed information about the agency. “We depend much on our customers that’s why we don’t entertain bureaucracy and corruption we need people to get good service they wish to get from us. We invite them to visit our pavilion at sabasaba they will get what they need because we have deployed a good number of our staff,” said Nyaisa.
