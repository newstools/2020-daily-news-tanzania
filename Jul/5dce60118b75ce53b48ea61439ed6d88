President Magufuli said that the late Mzee Lusinde will always be remembered for his contributions to country though the various capacities which he served. “I am touched by the death of Ambassador Lusinde; I will always remember him for his contribution as the then Minister for Works, which is now the Ministry of Works, Transport and Communication,” commented Dr Magufuli as he consoled the widow Ms Sara Lusinde, relatives and friends.
