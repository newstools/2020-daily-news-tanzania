MEMBERS of Bonite Bottlers Limited (BBL) and those of its parent company, IPP Limited, were told to emulate founder of business institutions Reginald Mengi who was humble, hardworking and patriotic. Speaking during her visit to the BBL soft drinks plant at the weekend, Minister of State in the Prime Minister’s Office (Investment) Angellah Kairuki said: “Dr Mengi was very hardworking, patriotic and humble. You should emulate him by working hard while at the same time implement new projects that are his lifetime dreams,” she said. Ms Kairuki hailed BBL for its contribution to the national economy through tax payment, saying “paying more than 16bn/- during this year’s first six months of this year, is a good contribution to the national economy.” “May I take this opportunity to urge you to continue strengthening your investments by applying new technologies to increase production and the quality of your products while at the same time making sure you create more jobs,” she said. She thanked the company for its contribution to the community through its corporate social responsibility (CSR) programme which she said complimented the government’s efforts to improve people’s standard of living. For his part, BBL Head of Sales and Marketing Christopher Loiruk said the company’s performance which currently employed more than 600 people had been growing every year. “The company, which started with only one processing plant in 1987, is currently having seven of them which are operating. This enables the factory to produce more products which meet Coca-Cola international required standards,” he said. He thanked the government for cooperation with the company through the Tanzania Investment Centre (TIC). He said the company contributed a lot to the country’s economy every year.
