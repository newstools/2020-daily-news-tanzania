THE Executive Director of the Benjamin Mkapa Hospital (BMH), Dr Alphonce Chandika, has commended the first two retired nurses at BMH for pioneering nursing services when the 400- bed hospital was established four years ago. Dr Chandika, speaking during a ceremony to send off two retired nurses of the hospital, noted here that the two nurses worked at a period when the hospital had a shortage of staff members. “They are the ones who put the basics of good services at our hospital. They are the ones who made great contributions towards the hospital’s achievements,” said the hospital’s Executive Director while addressing nurses at the ceremony. The two nurses are among the first six members of the staff to retire from the hospital after clocking 60 years of age. The retired nurses are Ms Mwanaidi Lilanga and Ms Theopista Manyama. Dr Chandika urged staff members at the hospital to emulate the two retired nurses in order to retire from work with good records. On her part, Ms Mwanaidi Lilanga, one of the retired nurses expressed her delight over great cooperation with her fellow nurses, noting that BMH has registered immense achievements because of cooperation among the staff members at the hospital. “When the hospital was established, we were just 17 nurses, but teamwork helped us to carry out our duties efficiently,” she said.
