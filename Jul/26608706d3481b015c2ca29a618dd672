Conveniently, total expenses only grew by 17.5 per cent, which pushed up the operating margin to almost 40 per cent compared to 22.65 per cent for the first six months of 2019. However, on a quarter to quarter basis, the operating margin dropped from 42.56 per cent during Q1-20 to 36.85 per cent during Q2-20 as a result of a 10.2 per cent decline in the total revenue while expenses grew marginally by 1.3 per cent. The drop in revenue during Q2-20 is a result of a 62.4 per cent decline in transactions fees and 31 per cent decline in CSD fees, caused by slower market activities in the period of intense Covid-19 cases globally.
