THE mining sector has emerged as the major contributor to the country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) thanks to reforms initiated in recent years that pushed up mineral production and effective revenue collection. The sector’s contribution to GDP on a quarterly basis reached the all-time higher posting 15.3 per cent in quarter one (Q1) owing also to silver production growth. Among the activities that take place within the sector include quarrying, which is common in various parts of the country. The earnings also resulted from the establishment of mineral exchange centres that became focal points of sale for artisanal miners. The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said in its latest report for Q1 of this year that the contribution of the mining and quarrying sector was the highest quarterly-wise. It was also the highest in the last five years. “Mining and quarrying activities recorded the highest growth of 15.3 per cent, the growth rate was attributed to an increase in production of gold and silver…,” the NBS report for Q1, which takes 2015 as base year, said. The sector’s contribution in Q1 of previous year was 10 per cent. NBS said during the period under review, gold production increased to 12,404 kilogrammes in Q1 from 8,656 kilogrammes in the corresponding quarter last year. Plus, the production of silver increased to 3,128 kilogrammes in Q1 from 2,856 kilogrammes during the similar quarter last year. Salt production increased by 17 per cent to 35,497 tonnes from 31,321 tonnes. Gold was followed by human health and social work activity that grew by 10.2per cent; professional, scientific and technical activity 8.9 per cent; transport and storage and information and telecommunication 8.3 per cent; construction 8.0 per cent; administrative and support services 8.0per cent while other social services 7.8 per cent. However, the Q1 GDP slowed down slightly by 0.6 per centage points to 5.7 per cent from 6.3 per cent of the similar period last year. The value of GDP in absolute terms at current prices was 36.8trl/- compared to 33.5trl/- in the similar quarter last year. Further, the value of GDP at constant 2015 prices had increased by 5.7 per cent to 31.6trl/- in the first quarter from 29.9trl/- in the corresponding quarter of 2019. In April, the country recorded a historical total mineral revenue collection of 58bn/-, thanks to establishment of a mineral exchange centre in every region that produces minerals. The successes have been recorded despite challenges caused by the coronavirus outbreak worldwide. When dissolving the 11th Parliament in Dodoma last month, President John Magufuli attributed the revenue increase to the changing of mineral laws and regulations done by the House. “The laws and regulations assisted to curb smuggling and ensure closer supervision of the industry, hence increasing government revenues,” President Magufuli said. The creation of a ministry dealing with minerals also contributed to the outstanding performance in revenue collections. The data, according to the Head of State, showed that the sector grew by 17.7 per cent last year and increased revenues to 349bn/- from 194bn/- of previous fiscal year. For the 2019/2020 financial year, he said mineral revenue was expected to contribute 470bn/- to government coffers.
