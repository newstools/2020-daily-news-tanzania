TANZANIA Cricket Association (TCA) plans to invest more in youth cricket training programmes starting with the Under- 19 League whose aim is to strengthen a national youth team. The main purpose of the establishment of the league, besides strengthening the squad, is also to prepare the national youth team for ICC Under-19 African Qualifier Division 2. The tournament will kick off in January next year and Tanzania will be its host and six teams will be engaged in the tournament’s race for the top honours. Regarding the youth league, the TCA Communication Officer, Atif Salim told ‘Daily News’ that the tournament has been named as TCA Development League and has drawn Ilala Boys, Kinondoni Development, Upanga warriors, Lions Academy, Al Madrassa Boys and Women Combine. “The players playing in the league are from academies, U19 prospects and senior players who have come through the development programme.” “The idea is to give a strong platform for the U-19 players who are going to compete in the ICC U-19 African qualifier Division 2 to be held in January 2021 in Dar es Salaam.” “We also thought that the league can be a good platform for our women’s team to gain experience by playing with the U-19 boys. This would help them to sharpen their match tempo in international tournaments.” All the games will be played at Leaders Club on Saturdays in 40 overs format and include one women club in the league. The league kicked off last Saturday and Ilala Boys beat Upanga Warriors by 58 runs in the event’s opening game. Salim further added that TCA is determined to enforce local clubs to invest on youth’s development and launch academies just like Lions Cricket club. “In the following years, we want to try and enforce local clubs to also try and focus on young players and have academy of their own just like how Lions Cricket club have done. They have a good pool of their young players now playing in the development league.
