SIMBA confidently marched into the semifinals of Azam Sports Federation Cup (ASFC), setting a date with Young Africans, after thrashing Azam FC 2-0 in the quarterfinal clash on Wednesday. At a nearly half full National Stadium in Dar es Salaam, Simba came with intent to win from the onset and the first half goal by John Bocco was spiced up by Clatous Chama strike in the second half to seal the precious victory for the Reds. It was the fifth victory for Simba out of five matches against Azam in all competition this season. Bocco put Simba ahead with a towering header, sneaking in between goalkeeper Benedict Haule and Never Tigere to power home a well dropped in cross from Francis Kahata in the 39th minute. It was 2-0 in the 56th minute, when Chama netted a stunning goal after latching onto Shomary Kapombe blistering cross. This means Simba will face traditional rivals Yanga in the semifinal of the tournament, whose ultimate winner will represent the country in CAF Confederation Cup next season.
