THE Second Vice President, Ambassador Seif Ali Iddi is inviting both local and foreign investors to invest here since it is a potential place to invest in business, including construction of a tourist hotel near Karume airport in Pemba. “The airport is becoming busy, but there is still no tourists’ hotel close to the airport. I think this is an investment opportunity for investors,” this was a message Mr Iddi made when he inspected the on-going construction of Golden Tulip Hotel near Abeid Amani Karume International Airport (AAKIA) in Zanzibar City. He said having a modern hotel near the airport may attract travellers and tourists because it eases transportation, particularly to people with scheduled flights at night, and that many airports across the world have hotels nearby. The Second Vice President said Pemba Island also underscored the need to have fivestar hotels because business in the Islands has been increasing, necessitating the need to have improved services, including better accommodation and internal transportation. He thanked the Royal Group Company who are constructing the hotel at the AAKIA through the company Executive Director, Mr Hassan Mohammed Raza. The hotel is expected to be completed in October this year. Mr Raza said the Golden Tulip Hotel will cost about 17.1bn/- and will have 62 rooms, car parking area, and leisure centre for residents, while the airport operation manager, Mr Haji Haji assured the Vice President of security around the airport.
