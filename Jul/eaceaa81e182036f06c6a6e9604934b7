THE Prevention and Combating of Corruption Bureau (PCCB) has warned political parties’ candidates and the general public who would wish to engage in any form of corruption, the law would catch up with them. It further noted that it would not hesitate to institute legal action against them regardless of one’s political influence and status in the society. Speaking recently here, PCCB Director General, Brigadier General, John Mbungo said the bureau would arrest and publicly expose, whoever will be found using money to woo votes. He said unlike in the previous elections where corruption was widely experienced, his team this time was ready to ensure the coming general elections is not marred by such acts. However, he called upon members of the public not just to complain, whenever they spot any corrupt deal, but straight away report them. The PCCB Director General further said that already, there were signs some politicians were devising ways to bribe their ways, hence, warned them as well as the electorates that law would catch up with them. “Let me make it clear that whoever engages in corruption during campaigns or election shall not escape the long hands of PCCB, and we shall expose them in addition to taking legal steps” he added. Brigadier General Mbungo said that corruption should be shunned because, it is dangerous to any country, hence, all leaders regardless of one’s political stance should fight it. According to the brigadier general, elections provide electorates with an opportunity to evaluate performance of those elected in the previous elections, and assess also whether they deserve another term in office. In a related development, the PCCB boss warned the media not to be engaged into corruption acts, but remain focused and serve all political contesters equally.
