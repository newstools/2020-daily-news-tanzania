THE SPOKESPERSON for the Kenyan government has tested positive for COVID-19. Cyrus Oguna said he tested positive after making a recent trip out of the capital, Nairobi. “Recently having come from an assignment out of town, I developed mild coronavirus symptoms and got tested,” he said. “The results came back positive for coronavirus and I am now receiving medical care and responding well to treatment at an isolation and treatment facility.” Oguna has been a conspicuous figure in the government’s COVID-19 media briefings, often alongside the Health Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe. Kenya is one of the worst affected countries by COVID-19 in Africa, having reported 15,601 infections and 263 deaths. Only nine countries in the continent have reported more than 15,000 cases. The East African country reported its highest number of daily new infections on Thursday, as the health ministry registered 796 cases. Oguna’s confirmation of his test results come as the Ministry of Interior dismissed reports that the Interior Cabinet Secretary, Fred Matiang’i, had also tested positive for COVID-19 and was hospitalized. “The claims are completely untrue,” the ministry said.
