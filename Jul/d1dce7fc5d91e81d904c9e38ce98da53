PRESIDENT John Magufuli on Wednesday joined some regional leaders to send congratulatory messages to the new Malawian President, Dr Lazarus Chakwera. Dr Chakwera was declared victor in Malawi’s presidential re-run election by the country’s electoral body on Saturday after securing 58.57 per cent of total votes. In his congratulatory note, Dr Magufuli assured the Malawi government of total cooperation from Tanzania, especially on the economic development front. “I’m congratulating Dr Lazarus Chakwera for being elected the President of Malawi. On behalf of all Tanzanians, I assure you that we shall continue to cement our cordial relationships especially on aspects of economy and community development,” wrote Dr Magufuli on his Twitter handle @MagufuliJP. After winning the election, Dr Chakwera remarked: "My victory is a win for democracy and justice. My heart is bubbling with joy.” Dr Chakwera becomes the sixth President of Malawi, as successor to  Peter Mutharika who was in the office for six years from May 2014 to June 2020. Others in the list are Hasting Banda (1966-1994), Bakili Muluzi (1999-2004), Binguwa Mutharika (2004-2012) and Joyce Banda 2012-2014. The Malawi presidential re-run was held almost five months after the country’s constitutional court annulled the results of a May 2019 vote over irregularities. Some other African Heads of state who have sent their congratulatory messages are Edgar Lungu of Zambia, Emmerson Mnangagwa (Zimbabwe), Hage Geingob (Namibia), Filipe Nyusi (Mozambique), Cyril Ramaphosa (South Africa), Mokgweetsi Masisi (Botswana) and President of Kenya, Uhuru Kenyatta.
