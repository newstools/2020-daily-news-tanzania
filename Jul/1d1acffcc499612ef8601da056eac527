THE number of French tourists visiting Tanzania increased from 21, 000 in 2016 to 56,000 last year, thanks to the Tanganyika Expeditions Agency and Axium by Parker operators, who have been organising trips. Speaking at a meeting with French tour operators and tourism professionals in Paris recently, Tanzanian Ambassador to France Samwel Shelukindo told participants that the government of Tanzania had lifted restrictions on commercial flights and quarantine measures imposed on travellers since May 18, this year. He noted that international airlines, including Ethiopian Airlines, Qatar Airways and KLM had already resumed flights to Tanzania. “As it is the case in other countries, Tanzania was also affected by the Covid-19 pandemic, but now coronavirus cases have dropped significantly, thanks to the commitment and efforts made by the government under the leadership of our President John Magufuli and Tanzanian people who understood the challenge and complied with preventive measures to fight against the covid-19 pandemic,” said the ambassador. He added that the Ministry of Natural Resources and Tourism had developed national standard operating procedures (SOPs) for the management of Covid-19 in tourism business and invited potential tourists to consult the embassy. “In this respect, I would like to underline that Tanzania has started receiving tourists.  All precautions and preventive measures are taken to receive tourists and enable them to have an unforgettable stay. The government has also created an enabling environment to attract tourists.”
