THE Makundusi Village government is constructing a village secondary schoolgirls’ dormitory called ‘Makundusi’ in Serengeti District, Mara Region. The dormitory project is expected to cost about 160m/-, according Makundusi Village G overnment Executive Officer (VEO) Jacob Mbota. “The building is in final stages and it is funded by a village development fund,” Mr Mbota said. He said the village generated revenue from tourism investors operating in the district, including G rumeti Reserves. “We got the money from tourism investors like Grumeti Reserves which has contributed substantially to the construction of this dormitory,” the VEO said. He noted that the construction of the dormitory would relieve a big number of schoolgirls from low-income families from walking up to 10km to and from school every day. Makundusi is one of the government ward secondary schools with modern buildings, including laboratories, classrooms and teachers’ houses, thanks to G rumeti Reserves and other investors for continuing supporting development in Western Serengeti.
