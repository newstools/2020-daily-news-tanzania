THE Annual Headline Inflation Rate for the month of June, 2020 has stagnated at 3.2 per cent recorded in May, 2020, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) has said. The stagnation of the headline inflation explains that the speed of price change for commodities for the year ended June, 2020 remained constant as that recorded for the year ended May, 2020. According to NBS Acting Director of Population, Census and Social Statistics, Ruth Davison, the overall index went up to 120.74 in June 2020, from 117.23 recorded in June, 2019. Ms Davison told reporters here that Food and Non-Alcoholic Beverages Inflation Rate for the month of June, 2020 decreased to 3.8per cent from 4.4per cent recorded in May, 2020. “Annual Inflation Rate for food consumed at home and away from home for the month of June, 2020 decreased to 4.7per cent from 5.2per cent recorded in May, 2020. On the other hand, the 12-month index change for non-food products in June, 2020 increased to 3.0 per cent from 2.4per cent recorded in May, 2020,’’ she noted. She further added that the Annual Inflation Rate which excludes food and energy for the month of June, 2020 increased to 2.6 per cent from 2.2 per cent that was recorded in May, 2020. The National Consumer Price Index (NCPI) used to compute this type of Inflation Rate excludes food consumed at home and restaurants, petrol, diesel, gas, kerosene, charcoal, firewood and electricity. Excluding food and energy which are the most volatile components in the total NCPI provides a more stable Inflation Rate figure for Policy Makers. The NCPI measures the change over time in the cost of a fixed basket of goods and services that are purchased by a representative sample of households in Tanzania. A basket includes a list of 278 goods and services, of which 97 are Food and Non-Alcoholic Beverages and 181 are Non-Food items that are being priced on monthly basis. The NCPI weights are based on monetary expenditures relating to consumption for all households in the 25 geographic regions of Tanzania Mainland. The index weights are based on expenditures of both urban and rural households derived from 2011/12 Household Budget Survey and the price reference period is December, 2015.
