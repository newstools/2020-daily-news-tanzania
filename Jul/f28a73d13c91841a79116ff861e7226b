ALL roads now head to Masasi District, Mtwara Region with people from different corners of the country gathering here ready for the funeral services of the fallen retired President Benjamin Mkapa. The death of Mzee Mkapa has stunned many within and outside the country. Here in Masasi, about 600 kilometres from Dar es Salaam, the mood is somber but activities leading to preparation of the burial services have made the town busy. Traffic Police officers were well positioned at different points of the road to Masasi, to control the traffic heading to Lupaso village, the home of a global citizen and icon, Benjamin Mkapa. The road towards Lupaso village was busy; with vehicles making several trips to and from, as preparations for the burial ceremony wereongoing. Along the 11-kilometre road stretch, which branches off from the Newala highway to Lupaso village, works for clearing the roadsides were undergoing since yesterday morning, with residents cutting trees alongside the road. At the compound of the Mkapa’s home where the burial ceremony would be held on Wednesday, villagers, government officials and other mourners were as busy as bees. While villagers were clearing the place, army officials were preparing the grave which was dug at a place where Mkapa had made his wish that he should be buried there if he died. Other villagers, standing in groups with sad faces, were mourning the death of the third phase President. Most accommodation facilities were booked since it was announced that Mzee Mkapa would be buried at his home village, Lupaso, on Wednesday this week. Douglas Mkapa, a son of the late Mkapa’s younger brother, said he will remember Mzee Mkapa for molding him to become a leader. “I remember him for many things, he knew what it takes to be a leader and he was supporting me in my efforts to become a good leader,” he said.
