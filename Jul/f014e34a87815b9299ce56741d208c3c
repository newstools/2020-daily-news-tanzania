PRESIDENT John Magufuli has expressed his grief on the death of a political icon, Mzee Job Lusinde, saying he will be remembering him for his large contribution to the nation. Lusinde, the last of the first batch of cabinet ministers, died at the age of 89 years on Tuesday morning at 5am, while receiving treatment at Muhimbili National Hospital (MNH) in Dar es Salaam. President Magufuli eulogized the late Mzee Lusinde for his significant contribution to the nation when he was minister, ambassador and leader of CCM's elders. "Rest in eternal peace my comrade. You have accomplished a great job," mourned the Head of State,Â  who sent his condolences to the family of departed Lusinde, Dodoma residents and Tanzanians at large. Mzee Lusinde graduated at Makerere University in Uganda and upon completing his university studies, he returned home, his first posting as a teacher being at Mazengo Secondary School. He was equally active in political affairs. He joined the Tanganyika African National Union in 1955 and became deputy secretary of the Party in Central Province. Mzee Lusinde was appointed Dodoma District Executive Director. On the strength of good performance in that role, he was appointed minister in the first post-independence Julius Nyerere Cabinet, as the Minister for Local Government in the Independence cabinet of 1961. He then became Minister for Home Affairs in 1962. At the time of the army mutiny in 1964, when President Nyerere was forced to go into hiding, he showed great courage and remained at his post. He was not happy when he was re-shuffled to become Minister for Communications and Works in September 1965, but he has seen the post grow in importance since. On Tuesday, John Malecela, a younger brother to the Late Lusinde, said the updates over burial arrangements would be made public upon consultations among family members. Mzee Lusinde will be buried in Dodoma capital city.
