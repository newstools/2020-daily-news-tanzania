OFFICIALS of Tanzania Social Action Fund (TASAF) in Mwanza Region have been urged to properly supervise the implementation of the fund’s second phase programme by identifying all ghost beneficiaries and ensure that money is given to the targeted people. The TASAF Community Support Director, Mr Amadeus Kamagenge, told the fund’s staff and other government officials that the government provides the money to support the needy and that supervisors must discharge their duties effectively. Mr Kamagenge was speaking on behalf of TASAF Executive Director Ladislaus Mwamanga. He was addressing 47 officials and 13 heads of department in Mwanza city council who were brought together for training on the implementation of TASF phase two. He said President John Magufuli has been stressing on the proper implementation of TASAF programmes by warning officials and wananchi to refrain from violating regulations and the country’s laws. He said TASAF officials and other stakeholders must make sure that all regulations, principles and criteria are followed in giving the money to the needy. “This time around, we are going to ensure close verification of names of those who are supposed to receive the money, we must make sure that no mistakes are made,” he remarked. He added that the fund managed to reach 70 per cent of villages and streets across the country and that most poor people were supported. Mwanza City Director Kimoni Kibamba said that integrity and honesty was crucial in the implementation of TASAF projects. “ We need honest staff in this job; apart from the verification exercise, officials and the public must adhere to principles and regulations,” he further remarked.
