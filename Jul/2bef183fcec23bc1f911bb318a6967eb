NYAMAGANA District Commissioner, Dr Phillis Nyimbi has urged small entrepreneurs to adhere to safety measures at workplaces to avoid accidents. The DC made the appeal when opening a seminar for entrepreneurs in the district, emphasizing on the need to put safety gears at workplaces in order to propel industrialisation drive. The seminar held on Monday was organised by the Occupational Safety and Health Authority (OSHA) in collaboration with Small Industries Development Organisation (SIDO) in Mwanza. “Failure to observe safety and health precautions at their workplaces could cause loss not only to them but also the nation at large, because after getting injured they stop engaging in production activities, and spend much of their time in treatment,” she stated. She said some entrepreneurs have taken the issue of safety and health at their workplaces for granted as they ignore wearing safety gears, putting themselves at risk. This is due to the fact that most small entrepreneurs use chemicals as raw materials for manufacturing products. Chemicals pose serious health threat when misused, therefore Ms Nyimbi stressed that there should be serious measures to ensure entrepreneurs consider safe use of the chemicals when conducting their activities. On his part, OSHA’s Director of Research and Statistics, Mr Joshua Matiko, said entrepreneurs face various challenges, but they need to speak about the issue of safety and health in order to identify risk indicators and be able to avoid them before starting activities at their workplaces.
