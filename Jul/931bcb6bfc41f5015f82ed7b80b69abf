THE Aga Khan Health Service Tanzania (AKHST) in partnership with French Development Agency (AFD) and Resident Representative of AKDN signed signed a €300,000 (approximately 780m/-) grant agreement to establish infectious diseases units in Dar es Salaam and Mwanza. Speaking at a signing ceremony in Dar es Salaam on Wednesday evening, Regional Chief Executive Officer of Aga Khan Health Services in East Africa, Mr Sulaiman Shahabuddin said the grant will enable his organization to address challenges pertaining to infectious diseases control management. “These grants will enable the Aga Khan Hospital (Dar es Salaam) to adequately respond to pandemics such as Covid-19 focusing on inadequate health infrastructure and capacity,” he said. He said the Infectious Disease Unit will complement efforts of the Government of Tanzania in reducing the transmission and support the containment of any pandemics and protect individuals’ risk of severe to critical illness. Mr Shahabuddin added that the grant was provided as part of the worldwide “COVID 19– Health in Common” initiative launched by the French President and implemented by AFD in response to the worldwide public health crisis caused by the global pandemics. He said the grant will more specifically contribute to four thematic areas including Infrastructure development – to cater the increasing demand of infectious disease patients requiring expertise in clinical care through a standardized quality of care including diagnostic services and clinical care. Meanwhile, the Country Director of French Development Agency in Tanzania, Ms Stéphanie Mouen said, social commitments taken by AKHST have been vital for AFD’s decision to participate in the funding of this well thought initiative for AKHST and the country.
