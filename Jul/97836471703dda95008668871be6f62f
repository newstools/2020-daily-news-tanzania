THE government is contemplating scrapping off registration fees paid by paralegals in a bid to encourage more people volunteer in the legal service and reach many locals at the grassroots. Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Constitution and Legal Affairs, Mr Amon Mpanju, said in a press statement released here on Tuesday by the Ministry’s Communication Unit, that scrapping the registration fees would motivate and help more paralegals to reach ordinary people in villages. “Paralegals should be helped to reach more common people in need of legal services, especially the ones with conflicts, which in turn draw back their income generating activities,” read part of the statement. Mr Mpanju made the remarks while inaugurating Regional Committee for Coordinating Legal Services in Tabora, adding that there was a need for the paralegals to help people, who can not afford legal services but have genuine cases. On his part, acting Tabora Regional Administrative Secretary (RAS), Mr Hamis Mkunga, said forming the Regional Committee for coordinating legal services would help to address a number of conflicts facing Tabora Region residents. He noted that most people fail to get their rights, because they lack money to hire advocates for legal service, while others live far from legal service offices and officers. In Tabora Region the paralegals received a total of 358 cases in 2018/2019 fiscal year with 181 mostly related to land disputes.
