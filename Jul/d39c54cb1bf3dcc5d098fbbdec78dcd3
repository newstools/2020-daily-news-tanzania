THE 2019/ 20 Premier League season ended in a sombre mood for the three teams; Ndanda, Alliance and Lipuli who were officially relegated and joined Singida United at the First Division League next season. The results of the 3 8 th round matches, also saw Mbeya City who stamped a 3-0 win over KMC and Mbao who crushed Ndanda in Mwanza, pushed to the play-off stage after ending 15th and 16th respectively. But, Mtibwa who previously languished at the red zone, survived the relegation scare after their hard-earned victory over Ruvu Shooting. The league climax was sweet for Young Africans who reclaimed the second position after defeating Lipuli 1-0, and the victory condemned the hosts to the painful relegation. At Ushirika ground in Moshi, champions Simba rallied to beat Polisi Tanzania 2-1 in a match that merely served as pride restoration campaign. Despite being dumped into FDL den, Alliance were fought hard for survival, but their 3 -2 victory over Namungo at Nyamagana stadium in Mwanza didnâ€™t help them avoid relegation. They ended the season at 17th position to become the fourth team at the relegation belt. Players and officials had to wear black armband as the country is still mourning the sudden demise of the former head of state, Benjamin Mkapa who died in Dar es Salaam on Thursday.
