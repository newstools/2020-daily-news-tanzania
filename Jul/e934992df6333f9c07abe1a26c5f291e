PRIME MINISTER Kassim Majaliwa has called on religious leaders and Tanzanians in general to use houses of worship to preach and promote peace and stability. He made the call while addressing worshippers at Friday prayers at the Buhari Mosque in Ruangwa in Lindi. He stressed that it was important for Tanzanians to build trust, tolerance and love as all these factors contributed to the existence of peace and tranquility. “This country has built a reputation for being peaceful and stable; and it is because of the teachings taught by religious leaders,” he further remarked, adding: “Our country has now become a refugee centre for people who have lost peace in their countries, come here, pick valuable lessons and return home when safety is regained,” he said. He added that it was the responsibility of every Tanzanian to adhere to the sermons of religious leaders so that the country can continue to be peaceful. “Our country has made rapid progress in many areas. I believe this development has been largely due to the peace we have and this is due to the preaching of our religious leaders. Religion plays a major role in the running of the Government,” he said. He pointed out that the role of religious leaders in maintaining sustainable peace and social cohesion in Tanzania had always been crucial during general elections. Premier Majaliwa stressed that all Tanzanians should consistently strive to be envoys of peace, and not leave the task only to religious leaders.
