THE Morogoro District Commissioner (DC), Bakari Msulwa has called on village and ward leaders to address public complaints swiftly instead of waiting for top government officials to pay visits and resolve them. He made the call over the weekend while addressing Morogoro residents during which he listened to their complaints and challenges. He reminded Morogoro residents that the intention of the fifth phase government was to ensure that the people’s complaints were being resolved, stressing that it was the local government leaders’ duty to make sure that such tasks were undertaken at village and ward levels. “Failure to resolve people’s problems at local government level is similar to acting contrary to the government’s commitment of serving citizens. We must serve our people diligently and without discrimination,” Mr Msulwa, who was recently appointed to the post, stressed, adding: “I urge council leaders and experts to visit the wards and villages and resolve the complaints of the people, and make sure that village meetings are conducted in accordance with the laws and the resolutions made are forwarded to legitimate decision-making organs.” He further remarked that most people’s conflicts and grievances stemmed from irresponsible leaders who were obliged to spearhead economic development in their respective areas. The Director of Morogoro Municipality, Sheilla Lukuba, also urged the ward officials to convene legally sanctioned routine meetings in their areas of jurisdiction and present revenue and expenditure reports on development projects in their areas. “I urge street and ward leaders within our council to cultivate a culture of visiting the people and listening to the challenges they are facing and seek solutions for them,” said Lukuba. President John Magufuli appointed Mr Bakari Msulwa as Morogoro District Commissioner on June 21, this year, replacing Ms Regina Chonjo, who had retired.
