THE government yesterday evening received a consignment of herbal medicine used for treating Covid-19 known as Covid-19 Organics (CVO) from Madagascar. The arrival of the consignment has been made possible hardly six days after President John Magufuli informed the nation would make an arrangement to bring into the country, the medicine from the largest island nation in Africa. Minister for Foreign Affairs and East African Cooperation, Prof Palamagamba Kabudi, led the Tanzania delegation to bring in the country the consignment which was eagerly awaited. African countries that have already received the herbal medicine include DR Congo, Gabon and Equatorial Guinea. The Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Information, Art, Culture and Sports, Dr Hassan Abbas, who is also the Chief Government Spokesperson, confirmed through his twitter account about the arrival of the anti Covid- 19 herbal medicine. “Tanzania has today received the donation of the herbal medicine that helps to suppress the effects of Coronavirus from the government of Madagascar,” Dr Abbasi posted on his twitter account. Last Sunday, President Magufuli said he had been in talks with the Malagasy government for the latter to avail its Covid-19 medicine to Tanzania. “I have been in talks with the Malagasy government. They say they have discovered the medicine for Covid-19 pandemic. We will dispatch a plane to bring the herbal medicine to the country so that Tanzanians can benefit from it,” President Magufuli told the nation through his televised address last Sunday.
