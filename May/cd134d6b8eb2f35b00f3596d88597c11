STATE Minister in the President’s Office for Regional Administration and Local Government, Mr Selemani Jafo, has directed the Tanzania Rural and Urban Roads Agency (TARURA) to remove underperforming regional and district coordinators. Likewise, the Minister directed for the disbandment of all special committees on purchase which still make contribution into road construction projects despite the government dishing out funds for the projects. While launching the Board of Trustees for TARURA, Mr Jafo issued the directive, pointing out that some regional and district coordinators were underperforming, hence posing a challenge to implementation of the projects. “The underperforming regional and district directors should be removed from the posts and the committees on purchases should be disbanded,” said the minister while launching the board for TARURA to be chaired by Eng Florian Kabaka. Mr Jafo said the new Board of TARURA should review and make changes in special committee on purchases, saying President John Magufuli issued 33bn/- for various projects, but some purchase committees still continue with processes. “TARURA has begun well in maintaining its good image. The only challenge is meager budget. Now you should remove those who are letting you down,” he said.
