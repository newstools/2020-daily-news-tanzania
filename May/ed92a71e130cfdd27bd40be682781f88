STATE Minister in the President’s Office for Regional Administration and Local Government, Mr Selemani Jafo, has advised National Examination Councils of Tanzania (NECTA) and Tanzania Institute of Education (TIE) to expand the scope of revision period for students sitting for national examinations. Likewise, the Minister called on form six students across the country to adhere to subject’s time table issued by high schools to catch up on time when schools resume studies. Speaking in Ddodoma, Mr Jafo said the government in conjunction with education stakeholders was preparing a special programme to help students study while at home during the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) break. “I extend my gratitude to Education, Science and Technology Ministry for cooperating with my ministry to prepare the special programme to teach students while at home during coronavirus disease outbreak,” he said. Mr Jafo said the government offers the opportunity to keep students busy with studies during the pandemic break, urging parents and guardians to accord schools with maximum cooperation to implement the programme. “I urge all form six students preparing for national examinations to make use of the opportunity. Students should pay attention to the subject’s time table,’’ he said. Mr Jafo further urged teachers to make use of the opportunity to build capacity for each other, and that they should help students when they need explanation in studies. “I urge other teachers to make use of the programme to build capacity through teachers who are in this programme,” he said. Mr Jafo expressed his optimism over students who will start studying while at home by using the special education programme. He used the occasion to advise parents and guardians to supervise their children in their study instead of giving them assignments that have nothing to do with education. “I call on parents and guardians to give your children a chance to take part in the programme,” he said.
