After 46 years of marriage, a 68-year-old woman has finally given birth to twins in Nigeria’s Lagos state, an act that has brought her immense joy. Margaret Adenuga and her 77-year-old husband, Noah Adenuga, have been trying to bear children for years with no success, but they never lost hope. The two have been married since 1974, but their union never bore any child until now, and it was not for lack of tying. The couple underwent three IVF attempts, all of which were not successful. But their hopes remained alive that they would get a child in due course. “When we started, I kept assuring my wife, you will have it. It will happen. It will only cost money. I only asked my wife, because of her age, do you think you can still carry pregnancy at your age and she said why not? So, I said if you are, then relax, it’s not over until it’s over,” Noah told CGTN in an interview. On her part, Margaret said she took a lot of inspiration from her husband’s love and confidence in her. She said Noah stood by her side throughout the years, even though he got massive pressure from his kinsmen to find another wife to bear him children. “I never lost hope any day anyway. I used to tell him that before we move out of where we are living, we are going to carry our baby. Our baby will leave with us. Not only one. They are going to be two. And I’m a church goer. So in church I used to see many testimonies that there is nothing God cannot do. So I have faith in that. I stood on my faith that God will do it.” A fourth IVF attempt proved to be the magic touch in the couple’s quest for children, and it brought them double delight. Two children. Both babies and their mother are healthy, a daily source of joy for Noah.
