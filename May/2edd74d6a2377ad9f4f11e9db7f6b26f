ZANZIBAR University (ZU) is in a precarious financial situation, with its employees reportedly not having been paid their salaries for the third month running, a member of the House of Representatives claimed here on Friday. Mpendae Representative Mohamed Said Mohamed charged that for three months, ZU workers have not received their salaries despite writing to the Ministry of Education and Vocational Training to request for financial relief. “Unfortunately, neither the minister nor the permanent secretary has had even the courtesy of acknowledging receipt of the letter,” the legislator charged while debating the ministry’s budget estimates for next fiscal year. However, Education Minister Riziki Pembe Juma acknowledged the letter’s receipt but denied knowledge of the non-payment of salaries. “We are working on the letter and we cannot fail to operate this (ZU) university,” the minister assured the House. Members of the House approved 138bn/- to finance the country’s education sector. Out of the requested amount, 118.7bn/- and 19.5bn/- are for recurrent and development expenditures, respectively.
