RECYCLING of solid wastes in Mwanza City has generated employment to the youth and keeps the environment clean. A survey conducted by ‘Sunday News’ yesterday established that youth were engaging in the business by collecting heaps of solid wastes and selling it to Falcon Company based in Igoma which deals with recycling of solid wastes. Majority of youths found at a dust dump in Buhongwa Street said they had decided to engage in the business so as to earn income. “Most youth who are jobless tend to engage themselves in criminal activities like theft but since this company started to buy solid wastes for recycling, most of us have opted to collect wastes and sell it to the company where we can earn between 3,000/-and 5,000/-per day,” Mr Mambo said. Falcon Deputy Manager in Mwanza City, Mr Sanjay More, said they get solid wastes from collection points of dust and from the cleaned areas in streets and then they recycle them to get goods which are useful for human use. Mr More said that some of solid waste they use are High Density Polyester (HDP) and Low Density Polyester (LDP), through recycling process they get wood which can be used for making furniture for domestic and office use. He said that from the solid waste, they get wood which can be used to make high quality furniture. On his part, Environmental Officer in Mwanza City, Mr Danford Kamenya said recycling is an alternative to get wood, and the process helps to clean the environment and reduces dependence on trees for getting wood. “He said the process has multiplying benefits to our city since it helps to conserve the environment and to produce wood that is used for manufacturing different office and domestic furniture," said Mr Kamenya. Mr Kamenya said that they want Falcon to work hard to increase the value of its products so that it can be used to manufacture office furniture and stop dependency on imported furniture.
