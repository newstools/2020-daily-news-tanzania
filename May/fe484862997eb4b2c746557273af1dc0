THE Nile Basin Initiative has launched 2020 year nomination for excellent journalists, who promote factual and accurate reporting on Nile cooperation and Nile Basin issues. According to a press statement, the event identified as region media awards, which targets to recognise and reward balanced reporting on issues related to the Nile Cooperation and Nile Basin, will inspire journalists in the bloc to report more on issues surrounding the river. It seeks also to “promote investigative journalism and accuracy as well as creativity and innovation in presenting information about key topics to the Basin, including water security, energy security, food security, environment sustainability, climate change adaptation and transboundary water governance,” read part of the statement. It further noted that the award is opened to practicing journalists as well as freelancers in the mainstream media and multi-media outlets from the Nile Basin countries, including those NBI engaged directly through training and other events. “No entry fee is required, but only that they must be in one language out of English, French, Arabic, Kiswahili, Amharic, Kirundi and Kinyarwandalanguage. Entries in French, Arabic, Amharic, Kirundi, Kinyarwanda and Kiswahili should be sent along with a compulsory translation in English,” it stressed. The opportunity is for all print (newspaper and magazine), Radio, Television, Photography and Digital News Publication from Tanzania, Burundi, DR Congo, Egypt, Kenya, Rwanda, South Sudan, Sudan and Uganda. NBI emphasized, however, that submitted articles must have a transboundary perspective and published between July 2017 and March 31, 2020. Nile Basin countries agreed on February 22, 1999, to cooperate and develop the shared Nile Basin water resources, and substantial socioeconomic benefits, which promote regional peace and security.
