AT least 88,597 villagers from 28 villages in Bukene will benefit from a Lake Victoria-Nzega water project by 2035, the House heard yesterday. The Ministry of Water said in a written response when responding to Bukene MP Selemani Zedi (CCM) who wanted to know when the villagers would access water from the project. “The water project has reached Nzega Town. What is the government doing to extend the project to Bukene so that the villagers within the project area get reliable water supply?” In response, the ministry explained that the Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Authority (Ruwasa) had completed an architectural design for the water project from Nzega Town to Bukene Town and 18 villages would be covered. The villages are Shila, Kagongwa, Shigamba, Itobo, Lakuyi, Chamwabo, Kabanga, Uduka, Usongwanhala, Kayombo, Mwamala, Kishili, Seki, Chaming’hwa, Kasela, Senge, Lububu and Udutu, all in  Nzega District Council.
