DURING the week Dar es Salaam all-share index (DSEI), moved upwards mainly due to share price decrease of Kenyan listed companies and some locally listed stocks. The total market size decreased by 447.99bn/-while the domestic market decreased by 0.34bn/-. In the coming week, as the Covid-19 cases keep declining we anticipate local investors to dominate the market and stock market recovery, and the market performance to be maintained by the active local counters in terms of volume, turnover, and price movements in the bourse. In the industrial and allied segment, TPCC is anticipated to remain active during the week while in the banking, Finance, and Investment segment DSE and CRDB will maintain their activeness in the market with the lower volatility in their share prices. In midweek we expect 20 years Treasury bond auction to be held by the central bank. We may see oversubscription of the Treasury bond due to the higher appetite for government securities. Amid this Covid-19 pandemic, the Government securities are more considered as a safe investment since investors are looking to keep their safe their money rather than taking risk investment. Furthermore, the government securities yield curve may continue to remain normal, and weighted average yields are expected to decline, this indicates low funding cost by the government. In the interbank money market, notwithstanding the decrease in the weighted average rate (WAR) during the previous week, we still anticipate that WAR to be within a range of 4.00 per cent to 4.50 per cent with slight volatility in the high and low rate.
