Zanzibar football giants Mlandege said they would prefer the league to restart where it ended prior to its suspension in Mid-March this year. The club’s president Mbaraka Hamid told reporters here that the league should restart right from where it was so as to avoid inconveniences of fixture. He said his club had to suggest that after the president of Zanzibar Football Federation (ZFF), was quoted as saying he was not planning to nullify the league. He said his statement relieved the teams as it assured them a positive return to the league. He said all players and the technical bench are in good shape and safe from virus infection. He said they expect to resume training upon getting directives from the government and health experts. “We cannot start training as we are waiting for instructions from authorities and top football governing body. When we get the go-ahead will start training promptly,” he said. One of the tough contenders for the Isles League title, Mlandege are positioned fourth with 44 points. KMKM, who the league’s defending champions, are commanding the title race with 46 points.
