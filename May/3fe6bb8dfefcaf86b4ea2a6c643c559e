INDUSTRY and Trade Minister Innocent Bashungwa has directed all institutions that hoard empty oxygen cylinders of Tanzania Oxygen Limited (TOL) to return them to the company for refilling to cater for demand of oxygen for Covid-19 patients. Mr Bashungwa has, therefore, warned those with empty cylinders to take them back to the company for refilling or else face legal action. He told the Police Force to arrest oxygen cylinder hoarders at this time when the country was struggling to serve the lives of Tanzanians infected with coronavirus. His statement came after his tour of TOL at the weekend. He wanted to know what the company had done to ensure adequate supply of oxygen in hospitals to save the lives of Tanzanians suffering from the coronavirus disease. ‘Those cylinders should be sent back to the industry for refilling so that patients in hospitals could be served,” Mr Bashungwa said, adding: “We are fighting against this disease and the cylinders are very crucial because patients admitted to hospitals need them. So the Police Force should do their job to ensure the cylinders are available.” For his part, TOL Marketing Manager Daudi Mlwale said over 15,000 oxygen cylinders were still in the circulation despite several calls from the company asking those who still kept them to return them to the company. “We have been publishing advertisements asking people to return the cylinders, but the response has been low,” he said. Updates on the coronavirus transmission in the country show that Tanzania has recorded 480 cases of Covid-19. When giving the updates, Prime Minister Kassim Majaliwa said Tanzania had remained with 297 active cases of the disease, out of which 283 were in good condition and the remaining 14 were under intensive care.
