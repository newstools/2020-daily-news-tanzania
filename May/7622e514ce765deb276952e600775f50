PRESIDENT John Magufuli has won accolades for masterminding socioeconomic reforms, including his bold action on handling coronavirus (Covid-19), thus setting an example in Africa on how to deal with a crisis. Mr Hassan Tingilawanyuma (74) from Kamachumu Ward in Muleba District explained that President Magufuli was a dedicated leader who had been in the forefront in the fight against coronavirus. ”Being in the presence of a calm and confident leader in the time of crisis helps overcome the fear of the pandemic. While the government has cautiously and meticulously taken necessary measures to curb the Covid-19 outbreak, President Magufuli has ensured the pandemic doesn’t adversely affect economic and social wellbeing,” he said. He noted that the introduction of quarantines, special Covid-10 hospitals, ramping up tests, banning of sports activities, suspension of school and college programmes, controlling the number of passengers in public transport as well as the introduction of the mandatory use of facemasks in Dar es Salaam, the most affected region, are just some of the measures taken by the government to curb the pandemic. Ms Abela Kokulamuka (27) from Mugana Village in Missenyi District praised President Magufuli for his decision to pardon over 9,000 prisoners within a spell of four months. “In December last year during the commemoration of 58 years of Independence, President Magufuli pardoned 5,533 prisoners. Again, last week during Union celebrations he pardoned 3,973 prisoners. This is a very positive move,” she said. Since the outbreak of Covid-19 President Magufuli has assumed a counsellor’s role as from time to time he implores Tanzanians to take all necessary precautions without compromising their routine activities. The coronavirus pandemic is making the world fall apart as fear and panic ravage the whole humankind today. The pandemic has brought about hunger to millions of people across the world.
