THE government has trained about 1,480,900 women in Mainland Tanzania in maternal health during the 2019/20 fiscal year to reduce maternal and new born deaths, Parliament was told yesterday. In a written response, the Ministry of Health, Community Development, Gender, Elderly and Children said the government continued providing training through different means, including providing leaflets, advertisements on posters, as well as via TV programmes. The ministry was responding to Special Seats MP Sabreena Sungura (Chadema) who wanted to know when the government would accomplish its programme for providing education on maternal health. “Through this training, the number of expectant women delivering at various health centres increased to 83 per cent as of March 2020 compared to 64 per cent during the corresponding period in 2015/16,’’ the ministry noted. The government said further that the target was to ensure every woman was trained in maternal health by the end of 2020. “This particular education will make sure that all pregnant women attend clinic immediately after they are pregnant and deliver at health facilities so that they can be attended to by professional midwives, instead of relying on traditional midwives,” noted the ministry’s response. The ministry equally underscored a need for all girls and women between 15 and 49 years to receive education on maternal health, emergence services on pregnancy complications, sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and effects of drug abuse as well as HIV/Aids.
