UNITED Nations Secretary General Ant√≥nio Guterres has sent his deepest condolences to the government, Tanzanians and the family of the late Constitutional and Legal Affairs Minister Dr Augustine Mahiga who died in Dodoma on Friday. In his message conveyed by his Spokesperson, Stephane Dujarric, he described Dr Mahiga as an accomplished statesman and a committed diplomat who served the UN as a Special Representative and Head of the UN mission in Somalia from 2010 to 2013. He said Dr Mahiga played a fundamental role in the advancement of state-building in Somalia, assisting in finalising the Provisional Constitution and advancing the electoral preparations. On 9 June 2011, Dr Mahiga, along with the Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, oversaw a signed agreement in Kampala between the then Somalia President Sharif Sheikh Ahmed and former Speaker of Parliament Sharif Hassan Sheikh Aden. At the time of his passing, Dr Mahiga was the Minister for Constitutional and Legal Affairs and he had previously served as Minister of Foreign Affairs and East African Cooperation. The sudden death of Dr Augustine Mahiga sent shockwaves in the country on Friday morning, especially in the diplomatic circles in Tanzania, East African region and the world at large. He previously served as the Permanent Representative of Tanzania to the United Nations from 2003 to 2010.
