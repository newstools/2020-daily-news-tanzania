THREE chairs of the African Leaders Malaria Alliance (ALMA), have called for continued essential health services like malaria prevention and control, while responding to the Covid-19 global pandemic. This was said in a statement issued on behalf of the End Malaria Council by President of Kenya and current Chair of ALMA, Uhuru Kenyatta, former President of Liberia and the then ALMA Chair, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf and former Tanzanian President, Jakaya Mrisho Kikwete. “I am committed to working with fellow heads of state and government on a coordinated and harmonised response to Covid-19 to stamp out this pandemic while continuing to provide essential health services to our citizens,” he said. He added: “Nothing is more important than protecting our women, children and men from preventable and treatable diseases like malaria,” said President Kenyatta. He said the efforts will help to sustain the significant gains that have been made in driving down malaria cases and deaths over the past twenty years. Former Tanzania President, Jakaya Kikwete said to fight Covid-19 effectively and ensure hard-won gains in malaria are not lost, African nations must strengthen essential regional partnerships to develop coordinated and collaborative approaches to support public health systems. Kikwete is the founding Chair of ALMA, and currently he is an ambassador and advocate for regional approaches to health and development on the African continent, and a member of the End Malaria Council. On her part, former Liberian president, Sirleaf said, “Prioritising frontline health worker safety is a critical investment in the Covid-19 response that will provide short-and long-term benefits,” She said just like the Ebola outbreak in 2014, ensuring that health workers are equipped with necessary protective equipment, diagnostics and data tools will protect health workers and empower them to interrupt the virus while maintaining life-saving services against existing diseases like malaria. Currently, President Sirleaf is the World Health Organisation’s Goodwill Ambassador for the Health Workforce and a member of the End Malaria Council.
