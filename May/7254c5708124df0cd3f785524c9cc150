A number of countries in Africa are beginning to ease lockdown restrictions. In Nigeria, businesses have reopened to try to restart the continent's largest economy. Rwanda has loosened restrictions after 45 days of lockdown, even though a nationwide night-time curfew will be enforced and movement in and out of the capital, Kigali, is prohibited. In South Africa people have been allowed to return to work but must continue to observe distancing, the wearing of masks and washing hands. In Kenya, the health ministry has recorded a low turnout in its mass testing campaign after encountering unwillingness among members of the public.
