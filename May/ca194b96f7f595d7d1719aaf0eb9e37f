YOUNG Africans attacking midfielder, Haruna Niyonzima named Simba SC striker, Meddie Kagere as his best foreign based player, who has managed to maintain his perfect form in the Mainland Premier League. Niyonzima, who reunited with his former club Yanga during the past mini transfer window, has been a vital ingredient for the team and his pattern with Bernard Morrison is always eye catching. Speaking in Dar es Salaam recently, the Rwandan player openly described his fellow countryman Kagere as a player who has surprised many people in his country. “Most people in Rwanda thought he (Kagere) is old such that he can no longer shine in any league but immediately after coming here, he proved them wrong and has since excelled to maintain his perfect form in the top flight. “For me, I would give him a reward for that impressive performance he is doing here. He did not take longtime to cope with the country’s league,” Niyonzima said. Niyonzima also said he would like to see the league resuming and enable it end on the battlefield so as to let it finish in a fair way. “If they decide to cancel it, then the winner will be easily identified basing on the current standings but I could have loved to let it end on the field. “Who knows maybe we can win the league title and still do well in the Azam Sports Federation Cup (ASFC) and thereby still be able to represent the country in CAF club competitions. “For now, we just need to be calm and follow all the guidelines as provided by the concerned authorities on proper measures to contain the Covid-19 pandemic,” he said. On what other teams especially those based in Europe are doing to slash salaries of the players, Niyonzima said he is totally against the move to happen here, insisting that there is a big difference in terms of salaries between a player in Tanzania and the one in Europe.
