IT was motivating to see many of the top sports leagues and events are starting to pencil in dates for their return and as well to see many good innovations locally during this tense period of Coronavirus scare. Despite being very damaging to the entire sports fraternity, there are several innovative ideas and projects announced to be done or going on in some popular sports, most notably the renovation of cricket grounds, introduction of football syllabus for academies and modernization bids recorded by local football giants; Simba and Young Africans. We laud all sportsmen and women, teams and sports governing bodies that publicly announced projects, which is clear evidence that all of them were using the hiatus period positively to plan and implement best means of developing both the sportsmanship and professionalism in the country. Though most of the publicly announced projects or innovations to make sportsmen and women conduct no-contact training and lessons, had a huge success, still we believe not all went as planned or failed to yield fruits to the desired levels, therefore the organizers must work hard to ensure everything ends up positively. Renovated cricket grounds in Dar es Salaam, Tanga, Morogoro and Arusha, or the upgrading of Kassim Majaliwa Stadium in Lindi, all whose works done during the period of COVID-19 threat are among the most brilliant projects implemented during the period. Also deserve a hat-off include the Tanzania Football Federation(TFF) who have introduced a new football syllabus for registered football academies countrywide and that came at a time when Simba and Yanga came up with innovative projects that seek to enhance their professionalism. While we end by lauding all sports personalities for their recommended job in their fight for the killer virus, we would like to caution all sportsmen and women to continue observing safety directives in this hard time of Covid-19 scare as Tanzania has not been declared safe of the virus. We would like to see them staying safe as they have been doing in the whole period of hiatus as our safety and that of others is very important. We insist them to keep staying at their homes while helping to educate others what they should so that the deadly virus threat is completely wiped out.
