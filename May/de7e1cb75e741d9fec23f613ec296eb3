National Junior Under -12 tennis players have been urged to remain focus and continue with individual training safely at home to maintain their fitness level. The three junior team members include Nasha Dingo, Irene Misha and Eunice Kimaro. The trio faces a tough task to represent the country at the Africa Junior Under- 12 Championship later this year. Tennis coach Salum Mvita has told the ‘Sunday News’ in Dar es Salaam yesterday that the continental event that brings together top African juniors is scheduled to be held in September this year in Morocco. Tanzania juniors qualify for the annual championship after conquering other opponents to win the East and Central Africa competition title in Kampala, Uganda early this year. Mvita said the team has tough assignment ahead as the event draws top players who have also won titles in their respective African regions to qualify for this year’s finals. “All players are talented and have chance to shine in Morocco, but since most of sports facilities are currently closed due to the global Coronavirus pandemic, it make it difficult for players to practise a fact that can affects their preparation programme and fitness,” he said. Mvita added that as African event organisers were also still monitoring Coronavirus situation, it is better to make sure that all players remain safe, focused and fit for the event. “As we do not know yet what will happen for the September game, I want to remind juniors to do light body exercises at home, it is very important for them as we would like to go there with full confidence and bring home trophy,” he said. The coach also reminded the juniors and all players to adhere with all directives given by the health experts to protect themselves and others against COVID-19. “They should always observe stay at home order and wash hands with running water and soap,” he said.
