A LOCAL Secondary School student has developed an ExamNet App that would support fellow students to continue enjoying learning while at home to evade pandemic coronavirus infections. According to a statement made available to the ‘Daily News,’ the student, Moses Mbaga, aged 14 in Form One from Al-Muntazir Islamic Seminary developed the Exam- Net App as a mobile application that helps Primary School pupils (especially Class Five, Six and Seven candidates) to improve their education and problem-solving skills by attempting different tests through the system. It further noted that to support the government, he would offer the whole month of May a period for students to have free access to the application, when schools are closed for Covid-19 spread. The statement read in part that the ExamNet App is now available on Play Store and App Store for pupils to download and access different tests, which are prepared according to the National Examinations Council of Tanzania (NECTA) examinations’ format and guidelines. “The tests are prepared by a team of qualified and experienced teachers (authors) and crosschecked by another team (moderators) thoroughly, which must be satisfied that the questions meet all the required standards before registered on the app. “Already 40 tests (with a total of 2,000 questions) are on the system and every month a total of 40 tests divided as 20 being for English medium Schools and another 20 for Kiswahili medium of communication will be uploaded on the system. “Here each test carries 50 questions testing Mathematics, Science, Social Studies and English as well as Kiswahili studies,” it indicated while quoting Moses as self-taught software developer. Commenting on the initiative, Moses’ father, Rodgers Mbaga praised NECTA for supporting it with a technical team, and the Commission for Science and Technology (COSTECH) Tanzania Communication Regulatory Authority (TCRA) as well as Tanzania Education Authority (TEA) for the funds.
