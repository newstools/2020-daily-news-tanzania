FISHERMEN should be carefully when catching fish in Lake Victoria due to an unprecedented increase in water level. Mara Regional Commissioner (RC), Adam Malima gave the warning when he toured Sota, one of the fishing zones in Rorya District recently. “You need to be careful. Don’t play with water,” the RC cautioned Rorya fishermen. Already two men from Rorya District who went to the lake for fishing are feared dead, according to reports from Sota. Lake Victoria water level is reported to have increased more than any time before, as a result there are adverse effects on socioeconomic activities. Lake Victoria Basin Water Board (LVBWB) has in recent months been urging communities along the shores of Lake Victoria to be vigilant over the increased water level. Mr Malima also urged fishermen in Rorya District to stop supporting foreigners from entering the country illegally through unauthorised entry points. “This is dangerous at this time when the country is fighting against the coronavirus pandemic,” he said. The RC also reassured the fishermen that the government would continue strengthening security to protect people and their property. Mr Malima was accompanied by members of the regional defence and security committee. Rorya is one of the districts in Mara Region that borders Lake Victoria.
