ABOUT 456 people have been convicted of sexual offences through the implementation of the Sexual Offences Special Provision Act, 1998 and sentenced to serve jail terms, it was revealed yesterday. The Ministry of Home Affairs said in a written response in Parliament yesterday that, out of that number, adults were 373 while the remaining 83 convicts were students who impregnated their peers. “Recent statistics show that between January and December 2019, about 2,839 schoolgirls were impregnated and 1,244 pupils dropped out of school and between January and March 2020 about 992 children were raped while 133 others dropped out of school,’’ said the ministry. The Home Affairs Ministry was responding to Ileje MP Janeth Mbene who wanted to the ministry to say something on the rising rape cases and school dropouts. “There have been a raging debate over school pregnancy and dropouts, while in 1998 this House enacted the Sexual Offences Special Provisions Act, 1998, which amended various laws to have a law dealing with the offences,’’ she noted, adding: “How many criminals have been convicted of such offences?’’ she queried. The Ileje MP equally wanted to know the number of adults and students as well as identify the number of school dropouts. In response, the ministry admitted that several cases were at different legal stages while others had been heard and determined.
