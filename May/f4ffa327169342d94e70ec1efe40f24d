THE Zanzibar Social Security Fund (ZSSF), has donated food stuff and sanitary equipment to orphans and the elderly as part of its corporate responsibility during the Holy month of Ramadan. Mussa Yussuf, the Communication Manager of ZSSF, said they were delighted to support those in need, especially orphans, the elderly and less fortunate people so that they can live and enjoy decent life. Mr Yussuf said: “Making them happy is part of our aim, and we are pleased to reach out to the community. We donated to Mazizini orphans care centre and the elderly at Sebleni care centre.” The donation valued at 16m/-include sanitary equipment (water buckets, sanitisers, washing detergents and face masks), food stuff (sugar, wheat flour, cooking oil) and clothing for the elderly. Normally, individual persons, public and private institutions organise donations during the month of Ramadan annually, but it is unfortunate that this year the activities were limited due to Covid-19. Ms Wahida Maabad- Director, elderly and social welfare commended ZSSF saying “It is a timely aid as the world battles to win against Covid-19. We appreciate for the aid, and we call upon other organizations to emulate this noble gesture."
