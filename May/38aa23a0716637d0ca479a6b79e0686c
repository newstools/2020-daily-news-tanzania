A SINGIDA resident, Christopher Anyambi, who had swallowed a toothbrush, is now all smiles after a successful endoscopic procedure was conducted on him at the Benjamin Mkapa Hospital (BMH) in Dodoma. He was brushing his teeth on Friday morning, March 27 at his Kibaoni home when the toothbrush inexplicably slid out of his hand and slipped down his throat while he was speaking to his mother. The 27 year old man was rushed to a hospital in Singida municipality, but he was told to return after one week as a doctor who would treat him was not at the hospital at then. “ When I returned to the hospital after one week, a doctor told me that I should undergo an operation to remove the toothbrush and I was lined up for the operation on 27 April. B ut I hesitated to undergo the operation,” he said. He said he told his relatives on the operation he was going undergo, but they asked whether there was no other way out other than an operation. They advised him to go to Benjamin Mkapa Hospital in Dodoma. “I had agreed to travel all the way to the Benjamin Mkapa Hospital in Dodoma Region to seek an alternative medical treatment,” he said. A gastroenterologist at BMH, Dr Amonius Rutashobya, said the resident was ok to return home after the procedure, saying he would be given PPI drugs to treat bruises on stomach. He explained that after arriving at the hospital, he was told to conduct x-ray on his stomach to establish the presence of the toothbrush.
