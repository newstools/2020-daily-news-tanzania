Health officials in South Sudan have for the first time confirmed cases of coronavirus in camps for people displaced by conflict. Two people have become infected in a camp in the capital, Juba, and one in Bentiu in the north of the country. Health experts have been warning of the potential danger if the virus were to spread in the overcrowded camps, which are home to close to 200,000 people across the country. Years of conflict have left South Sudan with one of the least equipped health care systems on the African continent. There are 194 confirmed cases of the virus in the country.
