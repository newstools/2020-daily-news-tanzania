TARIME Resident Magistrate Bhoke Chacha is being held by Prevention and Combating of Corruption Bureau (PCCB) in Mara Region over allegations of asking and receiving 2m/-bribe. Mara PCCB Commander, Alex Kuhanda said in Musoma that the suspect allegedly received the bribe so that she could favour a complainant in a case. He said his office received information from the complainant who is also a businessman that the magistrate asked the money so that she could favour him. The suspect allegedly delivered the judgement while she was at home when she was on a maternity leave as opposed to a legal process of hearing and adjudicating on the case in court. "The suspect received the money while she was on her maternity leave at her residence in which allegedly convinced the complainant that she would favour him to help him receive remedies in a case brought before her," he said. In another development, PCCB has saved about 159m/-in the region since the start of this year due to actions of private lenders who loan money to borrowers with high interest rates. He said they had investigated into private lending institutions in the region which were often not registered and did activities illegally against procedures governing the country's businesses. "Often these lenders issue loans to borrowers mostly civil servants and, therefore, cause inconveniences to claim their benefits as they are forced to surrender basic documents, including bank cards during the lending process,'' he said.
