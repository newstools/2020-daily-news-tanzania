MUSOMA Rural lawmaker Nimrod Mkono is in critical condition with his illness “worsening” but doctors were treating him in an intensive care facility, National Assembly Speaker Job Ndugai announced on Friday evening. The speaker made the revelation in the august house shortly before adjourning to tomorrow, the budget session of the parliament for the financial year 2020/21. His remarks followed allegations by Special Seats MP Rhoda Kunchela that some ruling party MPs were not attending House sessions but continued receiving per diem from the office of the Speaker, and yet were not obliged to make refunds. According to the Speaker, the MP had used social platforms to accuse the office of the Speaker of favouring Musoma Rural MP Mkono given his recent measures that demanded all Chadema MPs who had absconded from the session to repay the two weeks per diem. “This is a high level of disobedience. Mkono has not been in the House for a long time as he has been undergoing medical treatment,” he said, adding; I want Ms Kunchela to apologise,” he said. The Speaker said Mr Mkono, who has been an MP for Musoma Rural constituency on a CCM ticket since 2000, has been in critical condition for a long time and needed prayers for recovery.
