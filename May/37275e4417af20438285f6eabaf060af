As the world races to create a vaccine, the World Health Organization and partners have launched the COVID-19 Technology Access pool. Itâ€™s an initiative aimed at making vaccines, tests, treatments and other health technologies to fight COVID-19. It was first proposed by President Carlos Alvarado of Costa Rica back in March. It will provide a one-stop shop for scientific knowledge, data and intellectual property to be shared equitably by the global community. This will help ensure faster and more equitable access to existing and new COVID-19 health products. While it will be voluntary and based on social solidarity, the W.H.O has called on all developers to join efforts in making it a success. Thirty countries and multiple international partners and institutions have already signed up to support the initiative.
