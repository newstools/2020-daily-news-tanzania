A BIG number of Zanzibar adults are still without the mandatory Zanzibar Resident Identity Cards (ZanID), and the responsible body should be accountable. Mr Rashid Makame Shamsi, a legislator for Magomeni constituency in Unguja asked the government to ensure that all eligible Zanzibaris get the ZanID which is prerequisite in voter registration for the next elections. The first round of voter updating/registration ended in March this year after registering about 400,000 voters, and the Zanzibar Electoral Commission (ZEC), is preparing to conduct another phase of updating the voters register to provide an opportunity for those who missed in the first phase to register. Zanzibar Civil Status Registration Agency (ZCSRA), established in 2017, is responsible in registering residents and issuing them with ZanID. The Minister for Regional Administration and Local Government, Mr Haji Omar Kheri promised to work on the challenges so that Zanzibar residents without Ids could get them as soon as possible.
