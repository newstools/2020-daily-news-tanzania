TANZANIANS living near water bodies have been urged to preserve them for future generations to also tap their fisheries resources. Making the appeal, while launching three patrol boats at Katembe, Nyakabango Ward in Muleba District, recently, Kagera Regional Commissioner (RC), Brig Gen Marco Gaguti further said: “Fisheries resources have great economic benefits to the nation all should conservation.” He said water bodies create some income activities to the locals, who also rely on them to get fish rich in proteins. Elaborating, the RC commended authorities in Muleba District for the initiative they took to buy the three patrol boats from their own internal sources in the 2019/2020 financial year, saying other District Councils should emulate them. The patrol boats would increase surveillance in Lake Victoria and minimise cases of illegal fishing and theft, where he hinted that the larger one has a capacity to carry between 12- 16 officers of the District Fisheries Department. The other two individually can carry 8-12 people and were handed over to Bumbire and Ikuza Ward Executive Officers (WEO), respectively. However, he warned fisheries officers to avoid taking bribes and unjustified fines from people they arrest, but instead issue electronic receipts. “Fishermen at the same time should also avoid bribing government officials, and learn to report officers, who demand bribes instead of taking legal steps,” added Brig Gen Gaguti On his part, Muleba District Executive Director (DED), Emmanuel Sherembi informed the RC that the three patrol boats were purchased at about 173.4m/- with funds sourced from their internal revenue in 2018/19 fiscal year, adding: “The Council also purchased one patrol boat to beef up surveillance in Lake Victoria.”
