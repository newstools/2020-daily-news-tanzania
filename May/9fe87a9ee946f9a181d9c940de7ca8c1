THE recent heavy rains that hit several parts of Zanzibar have left a trail of destruction, displacement and deaths, Mr Makame Khatib Makame, Executive Director of the Commission for Disaster Management has said. He said at least six people died and 200 others were displaced, more than 690 houses damaged in Unguja and Pemba. “Some of the displaced people are now living with neighbours or relatives,” Makame said. He said that roads, public buildings, bridges, and crops were affected by floodwaters, where several rivers broke their banks. “Arguably, this time the torrential rains were prolonged, leading to disaster,” he said. Since the majority of people here are Muslims who are currently observing fasting of Ramadan, the director said victims are also given essential needs required during the Holy month. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), floods can cause widespread devastation, resulting in loss of life and damages to personal property and critical public health infrastructure. It says that in the past two decades, floods affected more than two billion people worldwide, and that people who live in floodplains or non-resistant buildings, or lack warning systems and awareness of flooding hazard, are most vulnerable to floods.
