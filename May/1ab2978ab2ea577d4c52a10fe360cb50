KARAGWE District Commissioner (DC) Godfrey Mheluka has appealed to leaders from different denominations to continue praying to God to rid the nation of the novel coronavirus (Covid-19). He made the appeal while addressing leaders from different denominations in Kayanga Township on Tuesday. “Tanzanians need to know that the fight against Covid-19 spread will be successful if everyone heeds directives given by health experts to limit and break the transmission chain,” he said. Catholic Bishop Almachius Rweyongeza of Karagwe Diocese congratulated President John Magufuli on his bold decision not to lockdown the nation. “The lockdown would have catastrophic consequences for the country and people. We thank President Magufuli for his timely decision,” he said. For his part, Evangelical Lutheran Church in Tanzania (ELCT) Bishop Benson Bagonza of Karagwe Diocese called on Tanzanians to continue taking precautionary measures, including washing their hands using running water and soap and keep social distancing.
