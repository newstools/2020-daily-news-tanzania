He also said during the 2018/19 fiscal year the council bought one patrol boat, bringing the number to four. He appealed to Kagera residents and fishermen to conserve well fisheries resources for their own benefits and for future generations. He also appealed to fishermen to take precautions against coronavirus by washing their hands with running water and soap and adhere to social distancing. Meanwhile, 117 vanilla farmers in Bukoba District have been paid about 80m/-, thanks to government’s timely intervention. Bukoba District Commissioner (DC) Deodatus Kinawiro said farmers had sold their crops through Maendeleo ya Wakulima (Mayawa), an NGO dealing with the crop during 2016/17 crop buying season. However, for unknown reasons the farmers were not paid until last week, when the DC intervened. Mr Paulo Tindibebwa (73), a vanilla farmer from Maruku Ward, thanked the government for the timely intervention. Mr Kinawito also urged residents in the district to take precautions against coronavirus by washing their hands using running water and soap and keep social distancing.
