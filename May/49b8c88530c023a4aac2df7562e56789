ACTION Aid has embarked on a special awareness programme in rural areas to educate people on the spread and prevention measures against coronavirus pandemic. In collaboration with the government, the timely - ambitious initiative, among other things, will include conduction of a chain of capacity building sessions among local government leaders. Airing their experiences on understanding and perceptions over the deadly disease among communities in rural areas during the programme’s maiden training session held yesterday in Chamwino district, Dodoma region, the leaders observed that the situation was ‘very’ pathetic in areas of their jurisdictions. They informed that in most rural communities, there exists baseless notions and poor understanding about the pandemic, a situation which calls for serious intervention. “In some villages, communities foster negative belief that Covid-19 is an urban- based disease which mostly affects wealthy people in the society,” said Benedicto Thomas, Village Executive Officer (VEO) for Nzali village. Moreover, it was revealed during the gathering that in rural areas, majority of the people drink local brew excessively believing it will protect them against the killer disease. On his part, Matimba Pascal, Ward Executive Officer (WEO) for Buigiri spoke over absence of private preventive equipments (PPEs) in rural societies, particularly temperature testing devices. However, majority of the local officials underscored the need for the government to band with development partners to extend enough awareness in remote areas, if possible, through open -air public announcements (PAs). In his presentation, facilitator of the training, Dr Stephen Mwaisombwa, coordinator for coronavirus services in Chamwino district, practically taught the beneficiaries how to use PPEs scientifically, as well as other recommended preventive measures against the spread of coronavirus.
