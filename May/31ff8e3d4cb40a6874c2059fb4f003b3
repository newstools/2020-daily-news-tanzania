A one and a half year-old baby girl miraculously survived death after the Fire and Rescue Force (FRF) in Ngara District, Kagera Region pulled her out of a 30-feet toilet pit into which she had been dumped. The survival of the child is attributed to the swift response of the Force after it was alerted by Good Samaritans on the incident that left residents of the area deeply shocked. Kagera Regional Police Commander (RPC), Revocatus Malimi said thorough investigations were underway to arrest the suspects, including the mother of the child. “We are conducting thorough investigations to bring the suspects to justice, including the mother of the child. No stone will be left unturned,” he said. Mr Malimi said after being informed about the incident, the FRF, led by Constable Denice Minja, responded promptly. Minja was the one who entered into the deep pit at Murugwanza Primary School and rescued the child who is currently admitted at Nyamiaga Hospital, he said. Mr Malimi further explained that due to his bravery, Mr Minja has been promoted to corporal by the Commissioner for Fire and Rescue Force, John Masunga. Doctor in Charge at Nyamiaga Hospital, Dr William Mnyongele, said the child was in stable condition but had sprained her right leg. “The child is in stable condition. Her right foot was sprained but we are optimistic that she will recover soon,” he said. RPC Malimi has appealed to people in the region to avoid such evil acts and respect human life. Nobody had been arrested so far, he said.
