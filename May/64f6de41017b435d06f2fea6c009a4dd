IN response to the reemerging illegal mining of sand in various areas of Zanzibar, leaders at community level are being asked to act tough on the culprits by making sure they are arrested and their digging properties confiscated. Community leaders (Shehas) and councillors have been told that it is high time they act tough against illegal sand mining on water sources and water paths, leading to floods and major holes. After inspecting various ruined areas, Captain Silima Hajji- District Commissioner (DC) for Unguja Magharib ‘B’ district and Mr Soud Mohamed- Director, Department of Forestry & Non Renewable Natural Resources, Zanzibar (DFNR), said at different occasions that concerted efforts are required to curb illegal sand mining activities. “We are now facing floods along roads, water sources, electricity power poles, and residential areas, caused by the illegal sand mining. We ask Shehas and Councillors to arrest the culprits,” Haji and Mohamed said. “Our land experts have proved that sand mining is the main cause of floods in many areas,” said Mr Ali Abdalla Natepe- Director, Magharib ‘B’ Municipal Council, saying that public awareness also remains important in protecting sand. The booming construction industry which includes roads and mushrooming of buildings in Zanzibar have in recent years led to a boundless demand for sand, as one of the core resources required. According to environmentalists, the illegal and unregulated mining of sand has a major detrimental impact on land, and authorities have been prompted to ban unauthorised sand mining and regulate sand business.
