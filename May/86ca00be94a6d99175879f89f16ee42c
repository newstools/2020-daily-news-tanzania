NGARA District Council has collected about 1.313bn/- revenue from internal sources, thereby attaining its target set for 2019/20 financial year. Ngara District Council Chairman Eric Nkiramazina told the ‘Sunday News’ in a telephone interview that during 2019/20 financial year that ends on June 30, this year, the council had targeted to collect 1.3bn/-. “The good performance can be attributed to voluntary payment for business licences by traders, collection of revenue from crop levy, revenue collected from parking fees for vehicles at Benaco area and good cooperation of the workers,” he said. Elaborating, he said tax education to the public, especially traders, had helped a lot to increase tax compliance. Meanwhile, Mr Nkiramazina has cautioned parents against allowing pupils and students who are at home after closure of the schools due to coronavirus to engage in petty business. “My office has received reports indicating that some of the parents were using their children to engage in petty business at local markets. This is not allowed. We are making close follow-ups and those who flout the directive will be punished,” he warned. He stressed that all pupils and students must remain at home to control the spread of Covid-19, also insisting that people must wash their hands using soap and practice social distancing. Ngara District shares borders with two neighbouring countries - Burundi and Rwanda. He also appealed to people to report aliens in their respective villages immediately for necessary actions to be taken.
