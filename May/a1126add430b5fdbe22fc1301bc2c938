AZAM FC said they have succeeded to facilitate the return of their Head Coach Aristica Cioaba, who is expected to land into the country any moment from today. The Romanian trainer was a doubt to make it timely to join his team following travel restrictions imposed in his country due to Covid-19 pandemic. Speaking in Dar es Salaam, the team’s Information Officer Thabit Zakaria gave kudos to their representatives in Romania for getting the required documents to enable him fly back into the country. “Today (yesterday), we have a good news because our coach is returning back despite the persistent lockdown procedures imposed in his country. This has been accelerated by our partners in Romania. “The other good news for us is that our three players (Donald Ngoma, Bruce Kangwa and Never Tigere) who were also unable to get back from Zimbabwe due to international flight restrictions are now on the verge to arrive from June 1st this year, after their government announced to suspend the restrictions. “We want to make sure that they should get the first flight to Dar es Salaam for them to regroup with their colleagues, who are on the ground rehearsing for the remaining games in the Mainland Premier League,” Zakaria said. Azam has seven foreign based players who are yet to rejoin the team after jetting off to their respective countries immediately when sport activities were suspended in the country.
