THE Zanzibar National Housing Corporation (ZNHC) is spending 432m/- to renovate some of its dilapidated buildings on Unguja and Pemba Island. The move was announced by ZNHC Director, Ms Riziki Jecha Salim in reaction to complaints from tenants, who claim that living conditions in the buildings is unfriendly and require quick repair. Leakage, poor water supply system, and worn-out shutters are some of the challenges in the houses. “We have started major repair of our buildings with Block No 1 building at Michenzani and 16 buildings in Madungu Pemba, before we extend the renovations to other areas,” she said. Prior to the renovation statement, tenants in Makunduchi expressed their concern over poor living conditions in their houses, successfully demanding for repair of the buildings which are famously known as development buildings (Nyumba za Maendeleo). The buildings in Makunduchi, Gamba, Michenzani, Pemba, among others, were constructed by the first Isles President, Abeid Amani Karume in the late 1960s/1970s, but now they require major renovations.
