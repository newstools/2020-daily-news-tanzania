SERENGETI District Council has allocated about 25.2m/- for purchasing 838 kilogrammes of sunflower seedlings during the 2020/2021 Financial Year, the House was informed here. Similarly, the government is conducting an awareness campaign for private sector operators on buying, distributing as well as investing in sunflower processing factories. According to the ministry of Agriculture, as of March 2020, there were six industries processing sunflower in the district. The ministry was giving a written response to a question by Serengeti MP Marwa Rioba Chacha (CCM), who requested the government’s intervention in supplying sunflower seedlings after farmers switched from tobacco to sunflower farming as tobacco market was shrinking. In the same response, the ministry said that in December last year, the government approved nine new types of seedlings that were capable of producing more sunflower oil of between 32 and 42 per cent as well as harvesting up to between two and five tonnes per hectare as well as resisting diseases. “The ministry, through the Agricultural Seed Agency (ASA) and private companies will continue producing sunflower seedlings in order to increase their availability in the country,’’ the ministry noted. The government added that Serengeti District Council had purchased 400 kilogrammes of Hysun, and 33 sunflower seedlings valued at 12m/- which had benefited about 400 farmers in ten wards. The seedlings, according to the government, had the capacity for producing 800 kilogrammes per acre.
