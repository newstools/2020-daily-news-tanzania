Long-time border disputes between Haneti and Kwahenu villages in Chamwino and Kidoka and Muungano villages in Chemba have been resolved. The border disputes have come to an end after a team of land officers from the parties finalised an exercise of fixing beacons on the borders. Chemba Municipal lawyer Geoffrey Pima said recently that authorities from both districts would soon make a statement at a joint meeting to be convened in due time. “Authorities in Chemba and Chamwino have dispatched a team of land officers from both districts to resolve the disputes after villagers of Kidoka and Muungano complained about the encroachment of their villages,” said the municipal lawyer. Mr Pima said Chemba District had also resolved a border dispute between Handa villagers and communities living near Migori Forest Reserve in Chemba, pointing out communities near a forest were claiming that Handa villagers had encroached Migori Forest Reserve. “Security and defence committees from the two districts of Chemba and Singida met and resolved the issue,” he noted. Mr Pima explained that some of the causes of border disputes were beacons that were removed by some villagers. Chemba District Executive Director, Dr Semistatus Mashimba, explained that land and border disputes had been resolved by land officers from municipal councils and that disputes over land ownership had been resolved through land tribunals at ward and district levels. “Land disputes presented to my office or to the district commissioner have been resolved by involving the municipal lawyer and land officers,” he said. Dr Mashimba said the municipal council directed people involved in land disputes to seek legal advice, pointing out the municipal council resolved disputes in various sectors, including agriculture and livestock.
