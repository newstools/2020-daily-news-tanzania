TOURISM stakeholders are rooting for Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), to mitigate the effects of the novel coronavirus. The stakeholder, who met at the weekend, said it was necessary to put in place such SOPs and abide by them to save the sector of tourism from the adverse impact of Covid- 19. Mr Joseph Lawei, who works for a tour operating company, suggested to members of a meeting chaired by the Arusha Regional Commissioner that having such procedures was out of question at a time when the killer virus had put at least 477,000 jobs in jeopardy. “The disease caught us unaware and the sad reality is that we have failed to put in place a post Covid-19 strategy. A remedy to this is to have SOPs that will guide us to curb the killer virus,” noted the tour operator. Mr Lawei also rooted for the formation of a taskforce under the Ministry of Natural Resources and Tourism that will be monitoring the situation and update key players in the sector. Another tour operator, Mr Ferdinand Allen, challenged fellow stakeholders to have their eyes and ears on the ground and as coronavirus cases surged. “It’s a pity to see major hotels closing shop and the staff laid off. We need sound strategies to rescue the situation,” he said. While tabling his ministry’s budget estimates last week, Minister for Natural Resources and Tourism, Dr Hamisi Kigwangalla, said the number of people who would lose their jobs represented 76 percent of the total direct employment in the sector.
