A PROTRACTED land row pitting Happy Sausages Limited and the Arusha Municipal Council is now threatening the operations of the meat processing plant in the region. According to firm’s manager Mr Charles Hotay, the corruption-related dispute has seen the company experience difficulties in paying its staff. “Much as our title deed has been confiscated by the land registrar in Moshi, we cannot secure any loan and that is likely to compromise our services and eventually shut down the plant,” hinted Mr Hotay, while briefing Industry and Trade Minister Innocent Bashungwa, during the latter’s official visit in the region recently. Mr Hotay further appealed to the government to resolve the row which he said was jeopardising the future prospects of the company. “At the moment, we are eyeing the East African market with a view of discouraging the importation of Sausages from Kenya,” he added. In the same vein, Mr Hotay admitted that the Covid-19 was having adverse effect on the company’s operations as far as the hospitality industry was concerned. He revealed that more than 70 per cent of the firm’s market share was hinged on hotel facilities and tour operating companies. In his quick rejoinder, Mr Bashungwa tasked the Prevention and Combating of Corruption Bureau (PCCB) regional boss, Ms Frida Wekesi to act with speed in settling the dispute amicably. “I’m happy to learn that the anti-corruption watchdog is right on the case, but is imperative that it acts swiftly to resolve it,” he noted. The Minister assured the firm’s management that it will continue to support Happy Sausages’ endeavours with a view of achieving the industrialisation feat. The Company was founded in 1990 as an abattoir and meat processing plant arising from the customer need for value added animal products such as Cow, Pig, Lamb and Chicken and to promote livestock production in the region.
