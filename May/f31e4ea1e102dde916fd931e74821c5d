TANZANIA missing out in action in last year’s World Kabaddi Championship, is still haunting the national team captain Joseph Lusinde. National men and women teams were among those confirmed for the Melaka, Malaysia World competition only to withdraw at the eleventh hour. According to the Tanzania Kabaddi Sports Association (TKSA) Chairman Abdallah Nyoni, the country had to withdraw after failing to secure return tickets from the World Kabaddi. He said that World Kabaddi cancelled to fund them with return tickets at last moment and that cost not only Tanzania, but several teams from Africa, Latin America, America and Oceania. Nyoni said that as kabaddi was still unpopular sport in the country, it was difficult for TKSA to secure sponsors on their own for the trip. Tanzania star Lusinde expressed his sadness to miss out the World Championship action as they were well prepared to challenge. He said players were also highly motivated. Fresh from participating at the 2019 Indo International Premier Kabaddi League in India after he was selected among the few foreign players, Lusinde said he and his fellow national team members were well prepared for the tournament. “I hope next time I will be in Tanzania squad for World Cup. I’m looking forward to compete among top teams,” he said. He said that although they have participated in many local and international competitions but still, competing at World Cup will remain a top priority. Lusinde who was introduced to the game by one of his instructor Nyoni is feeling blessed after also become one of the first players, who trained under coach Abhay Raj Singh before making his first World Cup appearance in Punjab in 2016.
