THE CCM Parents’ Wing in Dodoma Region has appealed to the government to hunt for witchdoctors claiming to cure people infected with the novel coronavirus disease (Covid- 19). Dodoma Regional Chairman of the CCM Parents Wing, Dr Damas Mkasa, made the appeal recently, saying there were unscrupulous people claiming to have herbs that cured Covid-19. “The only solution to the pandemic is to abide by preventive measures announced by the Ministry of Health, Community Development, Elderly and Children and if one feels sick should go to hospital and not to witchdoctors,” said the Dodoma Regional CCM Parents’ Wing Chairman. Dr Mkassa directed the witchdoctors to stop misleading people over fake herbs because they won’t cure those infected with the deadly disease. However, he urged members of the public to differentiate between the pandemic and customs because diagnostic equipment is available in hospitals. “We should observe health measures to stop the transmission of the disease,” he said. Dr Mkasa urged the government to take legal action against witchdoctors who were misleading members of the public that they could cure Covid-19.
