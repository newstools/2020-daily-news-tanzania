Latin America has become the centre of the global pandemic, the head of the Pan American Health Organization warns. The region now has more daily reported cases of Covid-19 than Europe and the US. The WHO noted Wednesday that 106,000 new cases were reported in the last 24 hours, the highest daily figure since the outbreak began, with many of them in Latin American countries.
