TARIME District authorities have closed down a smallscale gold mine after allegedly discharging toxic effluent that killed 34 cows and a sheep on Monday. The domestic animals died after drinking wastewater from the mine’s gold sand washing pond. “What happened is negligence and we have arrested the manager and the operator of the gold mine. They will be taken to court,” Mara Regional Minerals Officer, Nyaisara Mgaya told ‘Daily News’ on Thursday Tarime District Commissioner (DC), Mtemi Msafiri rushed to the scene on Monday evening after being informed about the deaths of the animals. The DC directed the closure of the gold mine and livestock experts of Tarime District Council to ensure the animals were buried. He also directed environmental officials to go around and check if all small-scale gold mines observed environmental procedures. Local leaders are worried that the seepage flowed into neigbouring water sources. “We have asked our people not to use water flowing from the gold mine as we wait for the results of water samples taken by water experts,” Kewanja Village government chairman Bunini John said. Kewanja is one of the villages located near the giant North Mara Gold Mine. Water quality experts from Musoma Mara Mori Catchment Office also rushed to the scene on Tuesday and collected samples of water for investigation. Mara regional mineral officials say Tarime District alone has 37 gold mines belonging to artisanal miners. Villagers around the gold mines blame mineral officials for allowing the owners of the gold mines to operate without observing environmental rules.
