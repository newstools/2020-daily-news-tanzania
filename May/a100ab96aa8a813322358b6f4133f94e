Principal Resident Magistrate Huruma Shaidi conducted committal proceedings after the prosecution had completed the investigations into the matter. During the session, the prosecution, led by Anna Chimpaye, disclosed that during the trial at the High Court they would call a total of 33 witnesses and tender 18 documentary exhibits, notably death certificate, postmortem report and map of the scene of crime. The accused persons involved in the trial are Msigwa matonya, Mianda Mlewa, alias White, Paulo Mndonondo, Longishu Losingo, Juma Kangungu and John Mayunga, alias Ngosha.
