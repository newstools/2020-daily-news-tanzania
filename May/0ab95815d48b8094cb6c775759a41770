THE Dar es Salaam Institute of Technology (DIT) is spearheading various strategies to participate fully in resolving challenges facing Tanzanians in relation to the attainment of the 2025 Development Vision. “DIT is prepared to directly address technical challenges in the country through strengthening the DIT Co. Ltd, our subsidiary company through being a direct part of using qualified experts at all levels,” said DIT Principal Prof Preksedis Marco Ndomba. He was speaking in Dar es Salaam recently, at the opening of an induction seminar for members of the first Board of Directors of the DIT Co. Ltd at its main campus in Dar es Salaam. Prof Ndomba told the board members to contemplate fully the company’s policy of marketing DIT’s academicians and students’ creativity works and discovery to generate income and create jobs. Members of the company’s Board of Directors expressed their readiness to offer their expertise in pushing the company’s agenda forward, to attain the desired results of pushing forward the country’s development agenda. “My advice is that DIT Company Limited should work as an avenue for students of this institute and others in Tanzania to have practical training and also outsource some experts with different expertise than relying on only internal experts or trainers who are sometimes occupied with teaching and research activities,” said Novoatus Massao, one of the Board members. For his part, the company’s Director General, Mr Joseph Challo, expressed his optimism that his company would contribute immensely to DIT’s budget as it had qualified and experienced board members to take it to the next level. He explained that the company had undertaken various projects which push for a development agenda, like installation of road traffic lights in Simiyu, Dar es Salaam and Zanzibar. Other completed projects so far include rehabilitating the speed torch system for curbing speeding.
