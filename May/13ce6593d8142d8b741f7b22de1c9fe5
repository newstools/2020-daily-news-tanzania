FOUR people have been arrested for drinking and getting drunk in public during the daylight hours of the Muslim fasting, the police have said. Throughout the 29/30 days of Ramadan, Muslims are supposed to abstain from eating, drinking and smoking from dawn until sunset. Non-believers are also required to respect the fasting by not drinking and getting drunk in public. Acting Regional Police Commander (RPC) for Mjini-Magharibi Region Shadrak Masele Masija said the four people were arrested at Magomeni Street while drunk contrary to the regulations applied on the isles. “For those who are not fasting have to show respect to those who are fasting here. Simply buy, but not eat or drink in public,” the RPC said as he appealed to people not fasting, including visitors not to eat or drink in public. He said investigation was underway to gather enough evidence for the suspects to be arraigned, but it was not clear which law they were going to be charged with. Recently, lawmakers in Zanzibar approved an Act to repeal and replace the Liquor Decree and make provisions with regard to restrict, control, and regulate the importation, warehousing, sale, delivery and consumption of intoxicating liquors. Under the law, as regards to consumption, punishments include to forfeit a supply licence or a fine not less than 500,000/- or to imprisonment of not less than six months.
