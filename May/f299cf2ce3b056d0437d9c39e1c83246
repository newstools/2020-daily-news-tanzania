THE High Court of Tanzania in Sumbawanga Zone has made history by conducting its first case through a video conference, with parties stationed in different locations in Sumbawanga Town. High Court Principal Judge Sumbawanga Zone David Mrango told 'Daily News' during an exclusive interview that the system was time saving and cost effective. The High Court of Tanzania - Sumbawanga Zone is serving both Rukwa and Katavi regions. "This is the first time for this court in Sumbawanga to use a sophisticated system, which is considered to be cheap, less inconvenient and more efficient in handling cases. The application of such a system demonstrates the judiciary's mission of timely dispensing of Justice and making people access justice," noted the High Court Principal Judge. Video conferencing is a live, visual connection between two or more people residing in separate locations for the purposes of communication. It transmits static images and text between two locations. At its most sophisticated, the system provides transmission of full motion video images and high quality audio between multiple locations. It dealt with a criminal appeal No 61 of 2018 from an original criminal case No 375/2012 from Mpanda District Magistrate's Court. In his judgment the Judge Wilbrad Mashauri ruled in favour of Sindahebula Msavi (32), the appellant after allowing his appeal he had lodged to challenge both his conviction and sentence. On April 17, 2013 the Mpanda District Magistratesâ€™ Court sentenced Msavi (25) after being found guilty of sodomising an 89-year-old woman. Feeling aggrieved with both conviction and sentence, Msavi appealed to the High Court of Tanzania in Sumbawanga Zone against them. "The conviction entered against the appellant is quashed and the sentence imposed against him is set aside," the Judge ruled. Judge Mashaka further ordered that the appellant should be released from prison forthwith unless otherwise detained for other lawful matters.
