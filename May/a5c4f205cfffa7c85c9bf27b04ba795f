DEPUTY Minister for Agriculture Hussein Bashe has stressed a need for the Tanzania Cooperatives Development Commission (TCDC) to come up with a well-integrated management system that will enforce transparency, accountability and control the embezzlement of public funds. He gave food for thought to TCDC commissioners during a meeting to deliberate on a number of measures aimed at strengthening efficiency, accountability and operations of cooperative unions and societies countrywide. The deputy minister wanted the commissioners to change their way of thinking to foster and restore trust in members of cooperative unions and societies. Mr Bashe also challenged the commissioners to ensure TCDC operated efficiently and effectively. He said that could only be attained through change in the commissioners’ mindset as well of the cooperative union members. "Cooperatives are well managed. They are farmers’ key bargaining power and not service providers, but rather profit making entities," he insisted. "You will find a cooperative is registered for tea, but within the area and in a different season it harvests also maize, rice and simsim. Let's operate commercially." Furthermore, he said there was a need for engaging the private sector in buying crops. He dreamed of cooperatives that were business-oriented and profit making which set aside buying posts which would give the government a clear picture of volumes of sales, competition and pricing. Mr Bashe also pushed for the transformation of cooperative unions through their assets so that members benefitted from them and addressed challenges facing them. He said that could only be attained if TCDC came up with all cooperatives and society assets registered so that they could invest according to needs.
