IN an effort to improve production and productivity in the livestock sector, the Tanzania Agricultural Research Institute (TARILI), Mpwapwa cenrte, has introduced a special project on production and dissemination of improved blended goat species to livestock keepers and farmers in the country. The project targets to quench a thirst of increased demand for goat meat in the capital city and the country at large. Recently, there has emerged a sharp demand and shortage of goat meat, especially in the capital city due to major increase in human population. Head, Department of Small Ruminant at TALIRIMpwapwa centre, Marry Magonka told this paper in an interview that the produced breeds are being derived from mixtures of three different goat species, which are Boa (South Africa), Kamorai (Pakistan) and East African goats. She added: “The blended goats have been purposely made for meat and milk production and are of high reputation and standards,” Magonka informed that since commencement of the vital project, many success stories have so far been reported among livestock keepers and farmers who have adopted the improved species. “We have, and still continue receiving good responses from livestock keepers from different regions who come here to purchase the improved goats,” she stated. Moreover, in his supplement details over the project, Dr Wilfred Munisi, Director from TALIRI- Kongwa briefed that the initiative was a prestigious economic opportunity which must be utilized bravely by the residents in the central zone corridor.
