MORE than 19.5bn/- has been spent on improving infrastructure network and sanitation services in Mwanza City. Mwanza City Director, Mr Kiomoni Kibamba made the revelation to the ‘Sunday News’ recently, in the wake of remarkable achievements in improving city infrastructure such as street lights and cleanliness. Mr Kibamba commended President John Magufuli for providing Mwanza City with funds that were spent on fixing street lights, construction of a bus stand at Dampo area and a waste dump along Buhongwa Street. Mr Kibamba said construction of the dump had enabled the city to establish collection points which had helped to keep the city clean. Speaking in separate interviews, Mwanza City with residents of Uhuru, Balewa, Valley, Mirongo, Machemba and Sekou Toure Streets commended the government for improving the scenery of the city by fixing traffic lights and building of a bus stand. They said traffic lights had made the areas pleasant at night and enabled the people to cross roads easily. Ms Mary Susuma, a resident of Mirongo Street, said that previously, it was very risk for people to walk during the night while going to the Sekou Toure Referral Hospital but the situation had improved after installation of the lights.
