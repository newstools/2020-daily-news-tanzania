AT least 3,348 cooperative unions have been deregistered for recording poor performance and failure to observe stipulated regulations. Minister for Agriculture, Japhet Hasunga said at a press conference that 88 other cooperative unions have been put under special supervision of the district deputy registrar. The ministry was prompted to take the stern measure after the expiry of a 90-day ultimatum that was given to them to put their houses in order. The Minister said the unions were operating poorly and without following procedures and regulations that govern the sector. He said earlier, his office gave a 90-day ultimatum to cooperative unions to get back on track but the notice expired on April 17, this year. He said only 88 unions filed objections and that after thorough investigations, his office decided to task the district deputy registrars to conduct close monitoring of the unions. “The ministry has deregistered 3,348 cooperative unions, most of which did not even exist and their modes of operations were disorganised,” he noted. Giving the breakdown of the deregistered unions, the minister said 2,513 were Saccos, 229-Amcos, 77-livestock associations, 27-consumers organisations, 70-service providers entities, 15-beekeping associations, nine landlords organisations and many others. The list also covers 22-miners associations, 79-industrial associations, 32-fisheries associations, 31-irrigation scheme associations and 244-others. Following the deregistration, the minister said the number of permanent registered cooperatives unions and societies now stood at 8,611. “We are continuing with the process of going through documents; Whoever violates the stipulated regulations will be axed,” he cautioned. He stressed that leaders of cooperative unions and societies should be guided by the laid down rules, procedures and guidelines to have in place unions that stand for improved welfare of its members. Mr Hasunga said that due to shortcomings in the operations of some associations and unions, the government was finalising amendments of the Cooperatives Union Act so that it copes with the current market needs and demands. “The unions continue to be worsening contrary to the government’s expectations. One of the main reasons is that leaders of these unions have consistently misused funds,” the minister said. In November last year, Minister Hasunga tasked the Prevention and Combating of Corruption Bureau (PCCB), to investigate fraudulent and corrupt practices on financial expenditure of cooperative unions. According to a summary report presented to the PCCB, he said the total amount of money suspected to have fraud and corruption indicators was 124,053,250,874/-. According to him, the investigation into the allegation was being conducted in phases, whereby the first phase was reported on January 22, 2020 and the second phase on March 14, 2020. The Director General, Brigadier General John Mbungo pointed out that as PCCB completed the second phase of the investigation on March 14, 2020, the amount of money investigated reached 66,255,488,545/73, the amount of money already saved was 8,898,661,156/88 and they were continuing investigating 57,356,827,388/85.
