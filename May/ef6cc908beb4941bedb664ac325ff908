AT least 134 Tanzanians who were stranded in Dubai as a result of cancellation of international flights in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic arrived in Dar es Salaam aboard a Dubai plane. They arrived at around 7pm and were all screened before they were allowed to go home. Speaking shortly after arriving at Julius Nyerere International Airport, some of them highly commended the government for facilitating their return home. “It was not easy at all especially after the lockdown; we exhausted all our savings in Dubai, the situation was not good at all,” said one of the arrivals. They said due to the difficult economic situation they were going through, some of them decided to contribute transport fare for colleagues who had no money. “We had to contribute some money to help fellow Tanzanians who had no money and we are glad we all made it back home,” said one Jaku Hassan. On May 15, this year, some 246 Tanzanians arrived in Tanzania from India after the government through ministry of foreign Affairs interventions. The citizens arrived from India aboard an Air Tanzania’s Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner plane. According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and East African Cooperation, the arrangement to bring back the first group of Tanzanians from India was facilitated by the office of the High Commissioner in India, Air Tanzania Corporation Limited (ATCL) and the diaspora in India.
