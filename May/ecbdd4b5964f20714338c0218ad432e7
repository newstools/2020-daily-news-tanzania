THE government through the Tanzania Tourist Board (TTB) has launched a special film to market tourist sites worldwide with a slogan: ‘ Tanzania unforgettable’. Minister for Natural Resources and Tourism, Dr Hamis Kigwangalla, said Tanzania had continued marketing its tourist attractions despite the coronavirus pandemic. He said measures taken by the fifth phase government under President John Magufuli to combat the pandemic had been implemented without affecting economic sectors, including tourism. “I commend Dr Magufuli for leading the nation well in the fight against Covid-19 without affecting economic sectors, including tourism and now we have opened doors for tourism businesses to proceed,” Dr Kigwangalla said. He noted that Tanzania was well-prepared to provide superb services to tourists by ensuring their safety and attract more of them to visit the country. Dr Kigwangalla said the government had reopened the tourism sector by observing all precautionary measures issued by various authorities, including the Ministry of Health, Community Development, Gender, Elderly and Children and the World Health Organisation (WHO). The minister, however, called on Tanzanians to share the film on social networks to reach the majority especially, the international tourism market. “This is a special film which has been produced to market Tanzania’s tourism in the international market with a ‘Tanzania unforgettable’ slogan, Dr Kigwangalla said. For her part, TTB Managing Director Devotha Mdachi said currently the country was focusing on marketing tourist attractions through online platforms. She said the new film would help market tourist sites in and outside the country. “TTB is currently marketing our tourist sites using online platforms. To date, we have live programmes through social networks such as Serengeti Safari Show and the programme is aired by Ngorongoro Conservation Authority,” she said.
