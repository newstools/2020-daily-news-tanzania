ALLIANCE FC defender Geoffrey Luseke’s agent Mohamed Hamis has confirmed that Kenyan Premier League (KPL) champions Gor Mahia are seeking the signature of his player. Speaking to the ‘Daily News on Saturday’ here yesterday, Hamis said the Kenyan champions have already talked to him, demanding the service of Luseke. Hamis added apart from Gor Mahia, there are also some offers from Zambian Premier League sides, demanding the service of his player. On his side, Luseke said he is ready to work with any team that needs his services. He also confirmed that he doesn’t have any plan of extending his contract with Alliance FC. Luseke contract with the Mwanza based side will end in June this year. He further disclosed he has been engaged in serious training individually for over three weeks at Mwanankanda grounds in Magu district, to keep fit at this time when the league is suspended due to coronavirus pandemic. He further called upon the Alliance FC fans and football fraternity in Mwanza to continue supporting their team in all their remaining matches. Alliance FC are still languishing in the relegation zone at the 18th position after gathering 29 points from 29 outings. They have won five, drawn seven and lost 14 matches. At Nyamagana Stadium in Mwanza, Alliance will play six matches against Ndanda FC, Namungo FC, Coastal Union, Police Tanzania, Mtibwa Sugar and Lipuli FC, while their away matches will be against JKT Tanzania at Jamhuri Stadium in Dodoma and Mbeya City at Sokoine Memorial Stadium in Mbeya. Their last league fixture will be at Uhuru Stadium in Dar es Salaam where they will face Simba SC.
