EVEN as the opposition --Chadema chairman Freeman Mbowe asked his Members of Parliament to go into self-isolation and stop attending parliamentary sessions, three MPs have opted to defy an order. Whether they will be reprimanded by their party or not, what remains certain is that the three Chadema MPs—David Silinde(Momba), Peter Lijualikali (Kilombero) and  Rombo's Joseph Selasini attended the session. The three opposition MPS attended a session as the government tabled the budget for the Ministry of Works, Transport and Communications. Last week, Mr Mbowe who is the leader of the opposition in Parliament and Hai MP warned Chadema Lawmakers from attending the session as the country battles Covid-19 pandemic. On Friday, the party asked its lawmakers to stop attending parliament sessions and isolate themselves after three MPs died of different causes. Last month, the parliament announced that one MP had tested positive for the virus. "We regret to continue receiving the deaths of Tanzanians caused by the Covid-19 infections," Mr Mbowe said in a statement as he called on parliament to suspend its business for at least 21 days and test all MPs, parliament staff and their families. "We believe more strict measures are needed to protect the lawmakers as well as the wider Tanzanians," he said. By Wednesday last week, Tanzania had confirmed 480 cases of the coronavirus and 16 deaths.
