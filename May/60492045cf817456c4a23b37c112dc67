CHEMBA District has resolved borders disputes between Haneti and Kwahenu villages in Chamwino, Kidoka and Muungano villages in Chemba, after a team of land officials from both sides finalised an exercise to establish beacons on borders. Chemba Municipal Attorney, Mr Geoffrey Pima, noted that authorities from both districts will soon make a statement in a joint meeting to be convened in a few days’ time. “Authorities in Chemba and Chamwino dispatched a team of land officers from both districts to resolve the disputes after villagers of Kidoka and Muungano complained over encroachment of residents from Chamwino,” said the Chemba Municipal Attorney. Mr Pima said Chemba district had also resolved the border dispute between Handa villagers and communities living near Migori Forest Reserve in Chemba, pointing out that communities near the forest were claiming that Handa villagers had encroached the Migori Forest Reserve. “Security and Defense committees from the two districts of Chemba and Singida met and resolved the issue,” he observed. Mr Pima pointed out some of the causes of border disputes includes removal of beacons on borders by some villagers. Chemba District Executive Director (DED), Dr Semistatus Mashimba explained that land and border disputes had been resolved by land officers from municipal councils, and that disputes over land ownership had been resolved by legal organs and land tribunals in wards and districts. “Land disputes presented to my office or district commissioner have been resolved by involving municipal attorneys and land officers,” he said. Dr Mashimba said the municipal council directs people involved in land disputes to open a case in court due to its complexity, pointing out that the municipal council resolves cases in various sectors, including agriculture and livestock.
