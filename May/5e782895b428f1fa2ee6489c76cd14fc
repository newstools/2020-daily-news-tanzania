BUSINESSMAN Edgael Lema has appeared before the Kisutu Resident Magistrateâ€™s Court in Dar es Salaam facing ten economic related charges, including unlawful transportation of 18 containers stuffed with 5,296 tree logs, which are forestry products, valued at over 383m/-. The 43-year-old resident of Goba in the city was not allowed to enter plea to the charges when he was arraigned before Resident Magistrate Vick Mwaikambo because they fall under the Economic and Organised Crime Control Act. Other charges include leading organised crime, forgery of documents, uttering forged documents, fraudulent tax evasion and money laundering. The magistrate informed the court that her court lacked jurisdiction to entertain anything, including the question of bail. According to the law, money laundering is not a bailable offence.
