THE government is planning to introduce a quota system for the importation of crops into the country in efforts to protect barley and wheat farmers, the National Assembly was told here. Under the new system, local processors of the two crops will be forced to purchase locally the amount they import from other countries so as to increase productivity among Tanzanian farmers. The statement was made in the parliament by the Ministry of Agriculture in a written response when answering a question posed by Special Seats MP Cecilia Pareso (CHADEMA) who had wanted to know what the government was doing to help barley and wheat farmers who no longer have markets for their produce. The MP said barley farmers in Karatu District lacked reliable markets of the crop since Tanzania Breweries Limited (TBL) which is the main buyer had ceased to purchase their products. “How will the government help these farmers?” she asked. In response, the Minister for Agriculture, Mr Japhet Hasunga, explained that the government was in talks with TBL, which was also the owner of a barley processing company in Kilimanjaro to restore the factory or lease it to another investor who can run it and process the crop. The ministry added that TBL and Serengeti Breweries Limited (SBL) annually enter into contracts with farmers to produce barley. During the 2018/19 financial year, TBL entered contracts with farmers to produce 230 tonnes of barley for the factory. Since there was plenty produce by the farmers, the company purchased barley from farmers in phases, whereby the last consignment was bought at 800/- per kilogramme. “Complaints about lack of market for barley in Karatu District is due to the fact that farmers produced a lot of crops outside the contract system,” said the minister.
