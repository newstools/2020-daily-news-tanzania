A MAJOR Same-Mwanga-Korogwe water project worth $300m (about 694bn/-) is expected to be completed in September this year. All requisite equipment for the project that was stuck at the Dar es Salaam Port due to tax issues has been released, the Ministry of Water has told Parliament. The project is funded by the government, in collaboration with Arab Bank for Development in Africa (Badea), Opec Fund for International Development (OFID), Saudi Fund and Kuwait Fund. The government waived VAT for the project’s equipment since November 4, 2019, meaning that it had been moved from the port and transported to the site, where the implementation of the project has begun. The ministry said this in a written response to Mwanga MP, Prof Jumanne Maghembe (CCM), who wanted to know when the project would start after the equipment was held at the port for over 10 months. “All necessary project materials have been at the port since January 2019 due to tax issues. When will the project start and when will tax for the project equipment be legally waved?” he asked. The lawmaker who at some point was one of the cabinet ministers told Parliament that Mwanga residents and those in neighbouring areas faced a serious water shortage, thus the project would help them greatly. In response, the ministry said the project aimed at solving water woes in 38 villages in Same and Mwanga districts as well as others in Korogwe District Council. The project will produce 103.7 million litres of water per day, while the current demand stands at 78.4 million litres per day, which will serve at least 438,931 residents in the three districts, 246,793 in Same, 177,085 in Mwanga and 15,053 in Korogwe.
