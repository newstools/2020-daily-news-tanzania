THE government plans to spend 150m/- in the 2020/2021 financial year to construct three dispensaries in Tarime Municipal Council in Mara Region. The project is part of the government’s efforts to improve provision of social services, including the health sector, whereby it is constructing dispensaries and health centres at every local government authority level. This was said in the National Assembly by the Ministry of State in the President’s Office, Regional Administration and Local Government when responding to a question from Tarime Urban legislator Ester Matiko (CHADEMA). The ministry stated that the government would not upgrade dispensaries to health centres, but construct new health facilities instead. It said that between 2016/2017 and 2019/2020, the government allocated 35 health sector workers to various health facilities in Tarime District. “The ministry has secured a permit for employing 610 doctors who will be allocated to districts with an acute shortage of the professionals, including Tarime district,’’ said the ministry. According to the ministry, the various initiatives taken to improve provision of health services are also meant to reduce child and maternal mortality rates. In her question, Ms Matiko expressed concern that the available dispensaries and health centres in Tarime provided medical services to a number of patients including those from neighbouring districts like Tarime Rural and Rorya. She claimed that the Gamasara dispensary at Nyandoto ward also serves patients from Kongo and Kitere villages in Rorya District and Kewamba and Nyangisya villages in Tarime-Rural district. “Over 50 per cent of patients going to the dispensary are from faraway villages; why is the government not constructing dispensaries in these villages?” questioned Ms Matiko. She, however, asked whether the government had any plans to upgrade the available dispensaries into health centres to meet the demand.
