THE Ministry of Health, Community Development, Gender, Elderly and Children is proposing establishing a single health insurance as a bill to table in the 12th Parliamentary seating. That was said by the Minister for Health, Ummy Mwalimu in Parliament when responding to a question from a Special Seats Member of Parliament (MPCCM), Kiteto Koshuma. The MP has urged the government to explain when it will table the bill that will compel the public to have health insurance provided by the National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF). In response, the Ministry said it is working on the matter, including coordinating the entire process of ensuring every national in health scheme. Ms Mwalimu pointed out that the insurance will not only help improve healthcare service, but will also cover every citizen for better health service, adding: “It eliminates the problem of fund that has been affecting so many trying to access healthcare service. “In implementing this, my ministry is working on the proposal that will bring single national health insurance. The process has been submitted at various stages of government procedures.” Even though, the minister said her office is waiting for the government’s approval to bring the bill into the National Assembly, it will be tabled and would remain the duty of the Parliamentarians to either approve or disapprove it, adding: “But we expect MPs to deliberate on the bill for the benefit of the nationals.” Meanwhile, the Minister has noted that her ministry is implementing various strategies in plan to help more people get covered by the NHIF. That was in response to Special Seats (MP-Chadema), Mary Muro, claim that Tumbi Hospital in Kibaha, Coast Region is facing shortage of essential medicines, and asked the government to increase supply so as to save lives. The MP also said besides the drugs’ shortage, the hospital also has few specialists to handle the growing number of patients admitted at the health facility on daily basis.
