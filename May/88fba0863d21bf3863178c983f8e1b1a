INFORMATION and Communication Technology service providers have been encouraged to reduce cost of the mobile and internet services to give consumers relief during period of the outbreak of coronavirus in the country. “We ask the Tanzania Communications Regulatory Authority (TCRA) look for ways for which mobile and internet service providers reduce cost or provide free service packages to users such as free Wi-Fi at commuter bus stops,” reads part of a press statement from the national coordinator of the Tanzania Human Rights Defenders Coalition (THRDC), Mr Onesmo Olengurumwa in Dar es Salaam. It went on to advise that Vendors of ICT products including mobile telephones and computers should reduce prices for their products to ease the burden on their customers given that most families have suffered a substantial loss of income as the coronavirus pandemic continues to bite.

The human rights activists were as well quick to warn for network users take precautions against online criminals, conmen and hackers, as well as mobile network users, internet users, and other users of electronic equipment including mobile telephones and computers. “We acknowledge the role of the National ICT Broadband Backbone in supplying internet services in Tanzania and in neighboring countries, police force should instead continue to protect online users against criminals who take advantage of the coronavirus pandemic to commit cybercrime,” he said. For Tanzanians to enjoy using the internet at this time of crisis, he called upon respective authorities to ensure that mobile network providers and internet users keep getting access to fast and reliable internet connection.
