LIWALE Member of Parliament (MP), Zubeir Kuchauka (CCM), has advised the Natural Resources and Tourism Ministry to intensify its plan for photographic tourism at Selous Game Reserve. In his question to the ministry, Mr Kuchauka stated that because the government vision was basically centred on strengthening hunting and enhancing tourism business through hunting blocks, it was high time plans were intensified in promoting it. “Why shouldn’t the government take that kind of tourism to Selous Game Reserve in the Southern Tourism Circuit of Tunduru and Liwale District,’’ he queried. In a written response, Deputy Minister Costantine Kanyasu said that during his working tour to inaugurate the Julius Nyerere Hydro-power project, President John Magufuli directed his ministry that part of Selous Game Reserve should be upgraded to establish a new one called Nyerere National Park. “A resolution for the establishment of Nyerere National Park was endorsed by this parliament on September 09, 2019 and given thumbs up by the Head of State through GN No 923 of 2010,’’ he noted. According to the lawmaker, the law was clear that activities that are allowed in National Parks were those of viewing and taking photographs and not hunting. “I would like to inform the MP that following the establishment of Nyerere National Park, Liwale and Tunduru Districts were part of areas that would benefit from photographic tourism in those areas." He added that a thorough assessment would be made to put up an entrance gate at the Nyerere National Park.
