KAGERA Regional Commissioner (RC), Marco Gaguti has commended the Bukoba Centre for the Arts, describing it as a milestone in sports development. He made the remarks recently, when he visited the Kibira Plaza located about four kilometers from Bukoba town. For quite a long time, Bukoba residents lacked a modern recreation centre. Completion of the project will speed development, he remarked. Mwesigwa Kibira, who is based in the USA, informed the RC that the investment project followed a call made by President John Maguifuli, on the diaspora to invest home. He revealed that the project would cost about 200,000 US dollars on completion and would be opened in July this year. He said it will offer employment opportunities. Also, the plaza would provide shops, offices and conference halls. Kagera Region has a long history in sports…..with some big names including the late William Majwala, Leonidace Njunwa and John Kaijanante (Boxing), Stephen Rweikiza, Adventina Matungwa and Claver Kamanya (field events/high jump) and Leopold ‘Tasso’ Mukebezi (national football team).
