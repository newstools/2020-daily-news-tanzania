He commended Plan International Tanzania for providing training and said the regional and local government office required training to reach Mwanza residents. For his part, Plan International Tanzania Manager, Dr Majani Rwambali, said they had decided to provide education to social welfare officials in Ilemela and Nyamagana districts for helping them to work professionally and give health advice to communities. He further said they would continue cooperating with the government in the fight against Covid-19. Dr Majani urged other stakeholders to turn up in big numbers to help the government eradicate the disease.
