THE police in Kagera Region are investigating an incident where the Karagwe Coffee Processing Factory (KCPF) was destroyed by fire, causing damage estimated at 1.6bn/-. Kagera Regional Police Commander (RPC) Revocatus Malimi said the incident occurred on Thursday morning during heavy downpour. "Initial investigation has revealed that, lighting struck the factory causing electrical fault... fire spread rapidly causing the damage. However, nobody has been arrested so far in connection with the incident," he said. Mr Karim Amri, the owner of the coffee factory, said about 22 machines were damaged causing an estimated loss of 1.6bn/-. Meanwhile, Yahya Deogratias (32) from Nyakabango Village in Muleba District was lynched by an angry mob who accused him of stealing a tin of beans worth 20,000/-. Mr Malimi said the incident occurred on Wednesday night, adding that several suspects, including the village chairman were being interrogated by police. In another incident, Jovin Zephrine (40) from Bujuruga Village in Karagwe District was killed by unknown people after a head of cattle invaded his banana farm. As he struggled to drive them away several young men armed with machetes assaulted him causing severe wounds on his body. He died on the way as he was rushed to Nyakahanga Hospital. The RPC said several people had been arrested in connection with the incident. "They will be arraigned after investigation. However, I appeal to people to avoid taking the law into their own hands. This is criminal. Instead, they should report any suspicious incident to nearby police stations for action," he said.
