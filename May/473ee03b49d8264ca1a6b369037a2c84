KYAKA and Bunazi residents in Missenyi District, who for a long time have been facing water problems, can now breathe a sigh of relief after the government set aside about 40bn/-for the implementation of a water project. Nkenge legislator, Dr Diodorus Kamala, said the implementation of the multi-billion water project was a milestone and would speed up people’s development. “We thank President John Magufuli for his bold decision to improve social services, including health, education and water sectors. For a long time Kyaka and Bunazi residents have been facing water blues resulting in contagious diseases like cholera and diarrhea,” he explained. President John Magufuli made a stopover at Kyaka on his way from Karagwe District last year and directed Minister for Water, Prof Makame Mbarawa, to ensure Kyaka and Bunazi townships accessed safe and clean water.
