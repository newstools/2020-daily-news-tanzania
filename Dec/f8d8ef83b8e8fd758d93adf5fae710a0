PRESIDENT Hussein Ali Hassan Mwinyi has so far revoked the appointment of four senior executives, including his Personal Secretary, Mr Suleiman Ahmed Saleh. Others are Director General of Zanzibar Airports Authority (ZAA), Mr Said Ndimbugani, Dr Ali Salum Ali- Director General of Mnazi Mmoja Referral Hospital, and Dr Jamala Taib- Director General in the Ministry of Health. Mr Saleh was sacked after serving in the position for only 37 days, but the others have been serving in their positions since the last regime under retired president Dr Ali Mohamed Shein. Article 53 of the Zanzibar Constitution of 1984 and Article 12 (3) of the Public Service Act No. 2 of 2011 empowers the Isles President to appoint and revoke any of his appointees. The Second Vice President, Mr Hemed Suleiman Abdalla last week directed job re-allocation of two senior executives in the Zanzibar City Council over filthiness of the streets. President Mwinyi has repeatedly warned all executives that he will have no mercy to public servants who are underperforming, engaged in dubious deals, or in corruption, and that it is a style he has copied from the union president, Dr John Magufuli. The state house has not explained the reason behind the ‘punishment’, but people are concluding from the president’s statements pushing for honesty, accountability, and hardworking in all public offices.
