A NONGOVERNMENTAL organisation, Kamanga Health Care Foundation (KHF), has introduced a new non-stress test (NST) technology to monitor foetus development in the womb. KHF Chairperson, Dr Mercy Minde, said this during the launch of the system that would be in use effective from next month at the weekend. “The technology is special for this specific group of expectant mothers. We intend to support the government in the fight against maternal complications, including deaths through the provision of affordable and timely health services to expectant women,” said Dr Minde. According to her, the new technology fights against maternal deaths when the mother is given immediate attention after the foetus development becomes questionable. “For instance, if the foetus’ heartbeat goes wrong, then we alert the mother and direct how to control the situation to save the lives of both the mother and her baby,” she explained. KHF, which operates under Kamanga Hospital in the city, will continue raising funds to enable other hospitals to have the same technology to expand services and make them available for every expectant woman. Regional Medical Officer (RMO), Dr Pius Rutachunzibwa, commended KHF for fighting maternal problems, saying the government did whatever possible to protect mothers and children. Director of Bugando Medical Centre, Dr Fabian Masaga, commended KHF for prioritising the health of mother and child, who he said, needed great care.
