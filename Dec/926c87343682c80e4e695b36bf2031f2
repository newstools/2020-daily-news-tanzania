ALL board members of Katumba Agriculture Marketing Cooperative Society (Amcos) have been subjected to investigation following reports of a loss of 122m/- from Agriculture Inputs Fund. The directive was issued on Thursday by Katavi Regional Commissioner (RC) Juma Homela to the Regional Police Commander (RPC) and the Prevention and Combating of Corruption Bureau (PCCB) Regional Commander. The Agriculture Inputs Fund is under the Amcos board and management. The two commanders tasked by the RC are PCCB Regional Commander Christopher Nakua and Acting RPC Abdi Issango. Mr Homera issued the directive while addressing the meeting that attracted leaders of cooperative societies held in the municipality on Thursday. “Already I have tasked regional commanders of both PCCB and the police to hold all Katumba Amcos board members accountable, including arresting and prosecuting them,” he said. “Embezzled funds must be refunded because at the Katumba Amcos general meeting all members tasked board members to refund the swindled money,” he added. Katavi Regional Assistant Registrar Ibrahim Kakozi said he had already formed a probe team of experts to investigate allegations raised by tobacco farmers related to the embezzlement of funds. He said despite the RC issuing directives on the matter his office had the responsibility to meticulously investigate serious allegations which emerged from the Amcos general meeting. “We will get to the bottom of this matter and whoever will be found to have been involved in this theft of money from the fund will be held responsible,” explained Mr Kakozi. The newly elected chairman of Katumba Amcos, Mr Ezron Eliachim, said foul play was discovered by newly elected board members after they were handed over the office by outgoing board members.
