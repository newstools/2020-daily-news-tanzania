THE Nyamagana District Court has sentenced Marco Saroti (60) to 30 years in jail after it found him guilty of defiling a Standard Four pupil. The Court also ordered the convict to compensate the victim 500,000/-. Reading the judgment recently, District Magistrate Gwai Sumaye said the offence was committed on March 29, this year, in Sinai Mabatini where the accused called a girl in his house and defiled her. The magistrate added that after Saroti committed the offence, he directed the victim to put on her clothes and gave her 200/-. The girl went back home, but some relatives noticed that she was unable to sit and walk properly. “A medical doctor’s remarks on a PF3 form stated that the pupil was sodomised. There were bruises, swelling, penetration and experienced a lot of pains during the examination. The accused person was charged of an unnatural offence contrary to Section 154(1)(a) of the Penal Code (Cap 16 RE 2019),” the in-charge read the judgment for such a criminal case No 87 of 2020. According to the incharge, the convict committed the offence while knowing it was contrary to the law. He said he was also aware of the girl’s age. The convict defended himself, saying: “I am old man, I have a family, nobody to take care of my family, I pray for lenience.” However, Mr Sumaye further read the judgment: “The accused person is charged of unnatural offence. I have considered the nature and gravity of the offence committed, I have also taken into account the age of the victim together with the accused person’s mitigation. The offence committed only attracts minimum statutory sentence of imprisonment. I sentence him to serve 30 years imprisonment.”
