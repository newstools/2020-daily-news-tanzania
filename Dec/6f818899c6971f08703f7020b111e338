WHILE cross listed counters are vividly on a rally, most domestic counters took a dip during the week that ended on 24th December 2020. JATU is still defying gravity as the climb is accelerated by each marginal growth of the absolute value of its price. Despite JATUâ€™s growth, its magnitude is too minor to be contagious to the general market. The Tanzania Share Index (TSI) lost 3.17 points following a 0.091 per cent deceleration of the domestic market capitalisation. Domestic market cap was dragged by the deceleration of three counters led by Swissport. Swiss went down by 5.08 per cent to close the week at a price of 1,120/-. Swiss has already fallen by 30 per cent since the beginning of the year following poor performance caused by a cut throat competition from NAS-Dar Airco. National Investment Company Plc (NICOL) dropped by 2.63 per cent to close the week at 185/- after moving 12,490 shares at a weighted average price of 185/-. Twiga Cement (TPCC) has put its rally on hold and took a dip of 1.57 per cent despite impressive performance reported in the half year results. TPCC closed the week at a price of 2,500/-. The All Share Index (DSEI) on the other hand gained 30.43 points following 1.71 per cent rally of the total market capitalisation. Except for Uchumi Supermarket (USL) and Kenya Airways (KQ) which is suspended from trading, all other cross listed counters appreciated during the week. Led by the heavyweights, East African Breweries (EABL) and KCB Bank went up by 6.45 per cent and 3.97 per cent respectively. National Media Group (NMG) climbed by 4.69 per cent while Jubilee Holdings (JHL) gained 2.56 per cent. Uchumi Supermarket remained stagnant similar to the last three years. The TSI closed the week at 3,483.78 points while the domestic market capitalisation stood at TZS 9,149.81bln ($3.96bln). Harmoniously, the DSEI stood at 1,812.12 points while the total market capitalisation closed the week at TZS 15,045.42bln ($6.52bln). The total equity turnover rose by 94 per cent after TBL pulled off one of its usual prearranged transactions on Wednesday. The total weekly equity turnover amounted to TZS 1.86bln ($0.804mln) after a volume of 713,726 shares was traded in 152 deals. TBL was the top mover off of the one prearranged deal which involved 298,000 shares at a price of 5,500/- per share. TBL accounted for 88.2 per cent of the total equity turnover during the week. The official closing price of TBL is still 10,900/- per share. The prearranged deal on the TBL counter involved foreign buyers and domestic sellers thus tilting foreign participation into net buyers. Foreign investors accounted for 90.85 per cent of the total investments with a net inflow of $0.73mln. Local investors accounted for 99.39 per cent of the total divestments. Market, Bills and Bonds The value of transactions on the Interbank Cash Market (IBCM) shot up by 125.7 per cent on a rise of activities that seem to have started on the Friday of the previous week. The total value amounted to TZS 84.2bln ($36.45mln) compared to TZS 37.3bln ($16.15mln) during the previous week. The weighted average interbank rate maintained volatility on the upside after an upswing of 68bps to 4. 18 per cent. The Treasury bills auction held on 23rd December 2020 was undersubscribed by 74 per cent following a significantly slowdown in the appetite of investors towards the 364days tenor. The 364 day tenor was undersubscribed by 79 per cent while the weighted average yield to maturity of the tenor went up by 23bps. The total offer by the Bank of Tanzania was the usual TZS 90.23bln ($39.06mln) while the total offer size from the public amounted to TZS 23.57bln ($10.2mln). Except for the 364 days, all other tenors were either fully or oversubscribed, while their yields remained similar to the previous auction. Currency Market Only three days are on record to have seen transactions during the week, on the Interbank Foreign Exchange Market (IFEM). Despite the fact, the amount traded is the weekly highest in recent recorded history. The total value of transactions totaled to $85.6mln while the weighted average exchange rate depreciated by 86 pips which is uncommon during the year. The exchange rate settled at TZS 2,309.97/USD at the end of the week. In the spirit of the festive season, on behalf of the whole team at Orbit Securities Co.
