SPEAKER of the National Assembly Job Ndugai on Wednesday pledged full cooperation to newly sworn in cabinet ministers, urging them to execute their duties diligently by attending parliamentary sessions and committee meetings where Tanzanians interests are being represented. Mr Ndugai said Ministers were obliged to attend the parliamentary sessions and standing committee meetings without being ordered by the Speaker. “It is important to attend the parliamentary sessions and committee meetings…you should not wait to be reminded because it is part of your responsibilities,” Mr Ndugai stressed while giving remarks at the swearing-in of 21 ministers and 22 deputy ministers at Dodoma State House. “For those who have been reappointed you should make self-assessment of your previous performance and plan ahead… the President wants to see the country moving forward,” he said. He asked them to avoid misusing their powers and instead they must work hard to meet wananchi’s expectations. The Chief Justice of Tanzania, Ibrahim Juma, on his side, called upon the cabinet ministers to deliver to the expectations of Tanzanians. He said that the ministers were highly indebted to Tanzanians due to the mandate given to them, thus they should work industriously for the welfare of the people. The CJ, however, said that the ministers were also supposed to work hard in executing  the National Development Vision launched by the  late third phase  President  Benjamin  Mkapa. “During the launch of the development vision the late Mkapa pledged to implement some of the issues in the first quarter of the 21st century ….This time will lapse during the end of your term thus you will be required to implement them,” the CJ said. He, however, pledged full cooperation to cabinet ministers.
