PRIVATE Agricultural Sector Support -- PASS Trust -- has called on women agricultural entrepreneurs to take advantage of the existing PASS Products to grow themselves economically through enhanced engagement in agribusiness. Speaking at the 2020 annual Madirisha Women Cooperative Society meeting held recently and graced by former Prime Minister Mizengo Pinda, PASS Managing Director Nicomed Bohay said women contribute significantly to the country’s development through their engagement in agricultural activities. Bohay said PASS Trust in supporting women in agribusiness will continue to ensure they benefit from PASS Trust Credit Guarantee of up to 80 per cent as opposed to others who benefit up to 60 per cent. “We understand how much women do, how much role they play in the agricultural sector. Our 80 per cent credit guarantee is meant to boost them towards accessing funds to support production,” Mr Bohay said. Madirisha Women Cooperative Society brings together women in agribusiness producing different products for sale. The society makes it possible for women to access markets as a group and bargain together for favourable prices. “And this makes it possible even for PASS Trust to be able to support these groups through our credit guarantee. Through PASS, these women will be able to access funds through our credit guarantee, and will enable them increase production and sell more. This in turn will benefit families by improving lives,” explained Mr Bohay. Over 1200 women who attended this year’s Madirisha conference were excited at how PASS Trust Credit Guarantee Scheme was favouring women in agribusiness.
