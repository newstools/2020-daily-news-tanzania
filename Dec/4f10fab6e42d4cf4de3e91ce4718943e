President John Magufuli is set to appoint another Deputy Minister for Minerals after newly appointed deputy; Francis Ndulane failed to take the oath of office in Dodoma on Wednesday. A video clip that went viral on social media platforms shows the Kilwa North Lawmaker, Mr Ndulane trying to take oath several times but failed. Speaking soon after the swearing ceremony, President Magufuli said he will nominate another person to fill the post since he was not sure whether the beleaguered MP will be able to read contracts pertaining to the mining sector. According to the Parliament of Tanzania website, Mr Ndulane holds Master of Science in Accounting from the University of Mzumbe.
