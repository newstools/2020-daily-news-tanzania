TWENTY eight riders have been listed to race in the maiden Dar-Moshi Bike Tour as its preparation is on a top gear ahead of the event’s flag off later next week. The 552.1km cycling race from Dar es Salaam to Moshi, Kilimanjaro is scheduled to start from December 18th in Dar es Salaam and climaxes two days later on December 20th this year. The whole tour, according to the organizers, will cover four regions. Gabriel Landa, one of the event’s organisers said in the city on Saturday that everything is going well so far. He confirmed to the ‘Sunday News’ that 28 cyclists, including himself, have been listed for the event. But, Landa said out of all 27 participants, there is only one lady, Ruth Wangui in the list. He named other participants as Abdu Elmahry, Ammar Yunus, Ammon Mwaka, Amon Hendry, Khuzeima Khanbhai, Eden Mushi, Frank Marariki, Godbless Baluhya, Hafeez Thawer, Hesam Thawer, Hillary Edward, Hubert Pius and Hussein Dossajee.

Landa added that the threeday race will have three service stops at Msata in Coast Region, Same and the final spot in Moshi in Kilimanjaro. “The first service stop will be at Msata, 195.2 km from Msasani, Dar es Salaam and the next day’s stop is Same, about 249.9 km from Msata. From Same, riders will complete the final 107 km distance to Moshi, the final destination.” He said that they expect it to be one of the most exciting tours due to the nature of the areas they will pass, hence, he urged more riders to come and jump into the tour’s bandwagon. Grand Dar es Salaam-Moshi Cycling tour comes after the successful Twende Butiama Cycling Challenge which is the longest bike tour in the country. It was held in October this year to honour the former President, Mwalimu Julius Nyerere.
