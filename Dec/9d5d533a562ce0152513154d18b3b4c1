Apparently, thousands of pupils who passed their Standard Seven national examinations this year will not be joining secondary education in January, because of inadequate classrooms. Elaborating, Minister of State President’s Office Regional Administration and Local Gov ernments Selemani Jafo said, all pupils who are eligible, but have not been successful in the first selection will be considered after classrooms are constructed by the end of February next year. In his address, he directed Regional and District commissioners whose areas face classrooms’ shortage to work with education stakeholders and complete their construction by the end of February next year. He also directed pupils who have been selected to report for the classes without restrictions, saying: “I urge parents and guardians to collaborate with the Regional and District Administrative Secretaries to ensure all students are enrolled for studies by next month and on time.” This is the first selection being released through the students’ selection management information system, where the minister noted that the system has helped to lower costs, save time and increase efficiency in the whole selection process. The names released yesterday reflect a 91.1 per cent of the eligible pupils who passed their primary exams this year with Mr Jafo further saying about 74,166 of them will be in school by the end of February next year. In breakdown, the number of pupils who will not be in classes in January has increased considerably from 58,699 pupils or 7.73 per cent in comparison to last year, when the figure was 8.9 per cent.
