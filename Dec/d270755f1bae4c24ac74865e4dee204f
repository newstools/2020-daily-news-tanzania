KEY players in the judiciary process have been urged to prioritise cases linked to Gender Based Violence as one of the workable measures to address the menace in the community. “If you handle such cases with priority, and perpetrators sentenced, it may help in the fight against Gender Based Violence (GBV) in the country, with reported incidents of sexual abuse,” State Minister-Constitution, Legal Affairs, Public Service and Good Governance, Mr Haroun Ali Suleiman said during a meeting with executives from the office of Director of Public Prosecutor (DPP). He said that proper coordination and collaboration among the police, DPP office, and court staff (Magistrates), would definitely narrow gaps which include delays in handling cases, used by perpetrators to escape or dodge prosecution. War against GBV is one of the areas that President Hussein Ali Mwinyi has promised to tackle during his tenure, asking members of the public to support the initiatives aimed at making Zanzibar [Unguja and Pemba] better place for all. Dr Mwinyi has already directed authorities in his government to find out what should be done, including review of the laws that impede ongoing efforts to stop violence against children and women in the country with an estimated population of 1.5 million people. At the meeting, which was Minister Suleiman’s familiarisation visit to offices and departments under his ministry, the DPP, Mr Ibrahim Mzee said that lack of public seriousness in stopping abuse such as shunning giving evidence in Court process and settling sexual abuse cases outside Court obstruct the campaign. “We ask members of the public, including victims and their relatives to show commitment in the war against rapists and other abusers of children and women, by exposing the perpetrators and accepting to stand as witnesses in court,” Mzee prayed. He said that record of GBV cases is still high annually, but through concerted efforts and full engagement of the public, it will be possible to end or at least reduce the cases, largely committed by people close to the victims.
