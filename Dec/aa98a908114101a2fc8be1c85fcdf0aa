NMB Plc has donated 400 roofing sheets worth 11.2m/- to support the construction of two secondary schools in Kasulu District, Kigoma Region. The roofing sheets were handled over to Minister for Education, Science and Technology, Prof Joyce Ndalichako, on behalf of Ruhita and Kidiama secondary schools. NMB Bank Western Zonal Manager Sospeter Magese said the donation of roofing sheets aimed at supporting the government to ensure all pupils who passed Standard Seven National Examinations joined secondary school education in January next year. Mr Magese added that the bank’s donation to the education sector was part of the lender’s strategies to support various projects as way of giving back part of the profit to communities in which it operated. Speaking at the event, Prof Ndalichako thanked NMB Bank for support, which she said complimented government efforts to create a conducive learning environment. Prof Ndalichako directed all education officers in the country to manage the construction of classes and ensure the projects were completed on time. She warned regional commissioners to avoid giving false information on a shortage of classrooms. Earlier, Kasulu District Commissioner Simon Hanange said 3,500 pupils had passed their Standard Seven National Examinations in the district and that they expected all of them were going to join secondary education next year.
