AUTHORITIES in Chalinze Council, Coast Region, have been urged to come up with strategies to raise funds for road construction and maintenance instead of depending on the government alone. Chalinze MP Ridhiwani Kikwete said at Tanzania Rural and Urban Roads Agency (Tarura) Office in Chalinze Council at the weekend during his two-day tour in his constituency. "Our council is leading in revenue collection in the country through selling gravel in and outside our region each year. I believe that it is high time we started allocating part of the money for constructing and renovating our roads," he noted. Earlier, Tarura District Manager Henrico Shauri told the MP that 774m/- had been set aside for fiscal year 2020/21 from the Road Fund which would be used for the maintenance of 114km roads, adding that already 214 had been received. He mentioned some of the roads which would be maintained this year as Pongwe Mnazi-Kifuleta, Magurumatare-Talawanda, Vigwaza-Buyuni and Kihangaiko-Mkoo. According to Mr Shauri, the council has 679km roads under Tarura and about 75 per cent of them are in bad state and need to be maintained. In another development, Mr Ridhiwani visited the ongoing construction of a government-funded Mlandizi-Mboga major water project worth 17.1bn/-. The project is expected to be completed by mid-2021. Dar es Salaam Water and Sewarage Authority (Dawasa) Manager in Chalinze District Honest Makoi told the MP that so far construction activities had reached 82 per cent. "Construction activities are going on well. We expect the project to benefit about 278,000 people in Chalinze Council, part of Kibaha District and some parts of Morogoro Region when it starts operating," he explained. For his part, Mr Ridhiwani thanked the government for support, adding that completion of the project would bring about improvement inÂ  water services.
