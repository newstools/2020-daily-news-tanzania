MINISTER for Energy Dr Medard Kalemani has  issued a three-month ultimatum  to Arusha regional Tanesco  manager  to complete the construction of  power station  at Lemuguru village in Arumeru district to facilitate power transmission from Singida to  Namanga border. Dr Kalemani issued the directive yesterday while inspecting the  implementation of the project that has now reached 70 per cent. The minister  also issued a three-day order to the project manager and his assistant who is the project engineer to give explanation in writing  with regard to the delay of the project which is being implemented by a company  from Bosnia. Dr Kalemani explained that delay of  the project has led to failure by Tanesco to connect power to  38 villages in Singida, Manyara and Arusha regions. The project is expected to enable Tanzania to sell surplus electricity to the neighboring countries , especially upon  completion of Julius Nyerere Hydropower Project along Rufiji River.
