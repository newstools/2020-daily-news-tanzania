THE government has vowed to continue the fight against chronic malnutrition that results in stunting- an irreversible condition that literally stunts children’s physical and mental growth. Director of Food Security in the Ministry of Agriculture Dr Honest Kessy said the government is implementing a series of measures to tackle the nutritional challenge in the country. Official records indicate that stunting was reduced to 32 per cent in 2018 down from 42 per cent in 2010. Underweight dropped to 3.5 per cent in 2018 from 3.8 per cent four years earlier. “We are working day and night to ensure we improve the situation,” he said, while calling for a collective approach from both the State and non-state actors to address the situation. He suggested the actionbased approach must focus on raising awareness in the community and changing customs or lifestyle on the type of food consumed daily. A recent midterm review showed food production especially corn has been increasing considerably but nutrition imbalances owing to non-diet meals is slowing the state’s efforts to battle malnutrition. Regions that recorded high maize production have also reported a high rate of stunting. The Ministry of Agriculture reported that Njombe had 53.6 per cent of stunting, Rukwa 47.9 per cent, Iringa 47.1 per cent, Songwe 43.3 per cent, Ruvuma 41 per cent and Kigoma 42.3 per cent. “There is no cure for stunting,” he said explaining that a stunted child is entirely affected throughout his/her life. In 2016, the government adopted a national multisectoral nutrition action plan which is implemented parallel with the second phase of the agricultural sector development plan.
