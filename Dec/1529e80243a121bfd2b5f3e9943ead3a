KAGERA Regional Administrative Secretary (RAS), Prof Faustin Kamuzora, has directed district directors to ensure they complete the construction of the remaining classrooms by January next year. He noted that the region had a shortage of about 250 classrooms. However, he was quick to point out that all eligible pupils would join secondary education in January next year. He said 45,427 out of 51,457 pupils, who sat for Standard Seven National Examinations (about 88.28 per cent) passed their exams and had been selected to join Form One next year. Out of the total number, 23,279 pupils (about 51.24 per cent) were girls, while 22,148 (about 48.7 per cent) were boys. The remaining 6,030 pupils (about 11.71 per cent) failed. Minister of State in the President's Office (Regional Administration and Good Governance) Selemani Jafo announced on Thursday last week that about 759,706 pupils had been selected to join Form One next year. He directed regional commissioners and district commissioners whose areas faced a shortage of classrooms to work with education stakeholders and complete their construction by February next year. However, Mr Jafo clarified that eligible pupils from nine regions, including Kagera, Katavi, Lindi, Mtwara, Mwanza, Njombe, Ruvuma, Songwe and Tabora would all join secondary education in January next year.
