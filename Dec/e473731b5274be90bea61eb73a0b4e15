SERENGETI District Council chairman Ayub Makuruma met Mugumu town traders on Tuesday to discuss improvement of the trading environment in the area. “My big agenda was to listen to Mugumu traders and hear challenges facing them,” he said in an interview. The traders blamed the Tanzania Rural and Urban Roads Agency (TARURA) for delaying rehabilitation of various street roads in Mugumu town. Makuruma held discussions with TARURA Manager in Serengeti, who said rains had interrupted the repair of the street roads in Mugumu. “I want to see Serengeti on the sky and not on the ground,” he said.
