YOUNG Africans’ Burundian tactician, Cedric Kaze has said that the 5-0 triumph over their hosts, Mwadui will help boosting up a winning morale to his players in other upcoming Mainland Premier League matches. Yanga were on siege at CCM Kambarage Stadium in Shinyanga as they dropped showers of goals to consolidate their splendid performance in the unfolding Premier League as they remain glued at the top of the table. In-form Deus Kaseke opened the goal gates midway in the first half which was later followed by a brace from rejuvenated striker Yacouba Sogne before goal contributions from Tuisila Kisinda and skipper Lamine Moro. As Yanga celebrated after the game, it was painful results for the hosts who have just won three games from 15 matches played and have conceded more goals (33) than any other team on the block. “The most important thing now is to make sure that the performance of the team is consistent and thereafter, goals will automatically come. “For today (Saturday), we are grateful to pocket three points courtesy of five goals we scored and I believe that individual confidence of players will improve,” said Kaze whose team is yet to taste the bitter side of the league. Queried whether his side will be busy at the market during the mini transfer window slated to be opened from Wednesday (December 16th to January 15th), Kaze replied that the leadership of the club will sit down to see the areas that need reinforcement. “If the opportunity will come, we will add some players but not for the sake of just signing but rather, we will be keen to see what extra skills he has to benefit the team,” said he. Again, the coach narrated that any day, they will unveil a list of players who will be released to join other clubs on loan deals. His counterpart for Mwadui Khalid Adam noted that his players spoiled early the game plan they had prior to the match.
