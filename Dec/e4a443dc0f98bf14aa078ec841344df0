A SCENE of celebrations engulfed ‘little theater’ on Thursday in Dar es Salaam as Regina Kiwele (Ginah) launched her new song dubbed ‘Its you’. In her brief remarks before she released her new song Ms Ginah ensured that she has come with some new flavours that will bring change to the music industry. “The type of music I bring to the table will most definitely change how people view soul music in the country. I will be the new face of music,” she confidently asserted. Ms Ginah made it clear that she had been in love with music and the entire artistic industry like fashion and acting ever since she was young; and now she has officially started her music career. She revealed that some of the artists she loves and are her inspiration include Vanessa Mdee, Mimi Mars and Grace Matata. “These are some of the female artists that inspire me in the music industry because they are hardworking and their music is beautiful,” she commented. According to her, the music industry at the moment needs more investment, as there are so many talented artists but they get stuck when it comes to financing their art. “That is why I urge investors who are passionate with their work or in this industry to enable such artists,” she reiterated. She further declared that there are ongoing plans to do collaborations with various artists; expressing other artists she wishes to collaborate with include Damian Soul and Young Lunya. Talking about her acting career she said that she started with acting in theatres in 2016 where she also managed to act in some few films, but is ready to get into Bongo Movies when an opportunity provides itself. “People should expect some good soulful music, as I have officially started my journey in this industry today. Get ready for some soulful, heart refreshing entertainment,” she asserted.
