KATAVI Regional Commissioner (RC) Juma Homera has urged all 200 students selected to join Sokoine University of Agriculture (Mizengo Pinda Campus) to ensure they report at the campus as scheduled. The campus was opened a week ago, but only 70 students have so far reported. The RC was speaking during his tour on the campus. At least 200 students were selected to join SUA and 130 of them have not reported. "Our goal is to ensure all 200 candidates report here at the campus as early as possible. Everything is already in place, thus we invite all selected students to come immediately,” he noted. SUA - Mizengo Pinda Campus (MPC) - is located  at Kibaoni Village, Kibaoni Ward in Mpimbwe Council, Katavi Region, about 1,160km from the main campus in Morogoro through Mbeya-Tunduma-Sumbawanga-Mpanda Road. The campus offers three programmes which are Bachelor of Science Bee Resources Management, Diploma in Crop Production and Management and Certificate in Tour Guide and Hunting Operations. On January 5, 2020, former Prime Minister Mizengo Pinda provided 26 hectares to SUA with modern buildings and 81 hectares for training.
