NATIONAL Assembly Speaker Job Ndugai has urged authorities in Dodoma to work together to improve school performance and national ranking. According to him, poor school performance in the country’s capital is shameful. Contributing during a regional road fund board meeting, the Speaker called for collective strategies that would help Dodoma schools to feature in the national top 10 rankings. “We must work together to improve the performance of schools in the region,” he said. The meeting was attended by all district commissioners, executive directors, MPs, chairpersons of councils and regional experts. He wanted authorities to rethink the plan and make it a five year’s target. “For decades Dodoma Region has been raking between 22 and 24 places out of 26 regions in the country,” the Speaker said, insisting: “this is unacceptable.” Dodoma Regional Commissioner, Dr Binilith Mahenge, said it was a matter of life and death to transform the region’s education sector. His views were shared by CCM regional chairman Godwin Mkanwa who noted that the performance of the region in education was encouraging. He said both authorities from village, ward, district to region levels must have one vision to ensure performance of schools improved. “This is part of the ruling CCM election manifesto,” he said, noting that newly elected leaders had demonstrated readiness to bring about changes in the region.
