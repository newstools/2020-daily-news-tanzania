Zanzibar President Hussein Mwinyi will form a probe team to investigate the collapse of the House of Wonders building last Friday. The team will also be charged with making recommendations how the old Stone Town can be preserved. Speaking earlier today (December 28, 2020) at Sheikh Idriss Abdulwakil-Kikwajuni Hall in Unguja, Mwinyi said the team is not intended to accuse anyone but to come up with workable proposals on conserving the Stone Town as tourist attraction. He was addressing Mji Mkongwe stakeholders who met at the Idriss Abdulwakil Kikwajuni Hall. He said he expects efficiency and diligence from the would-be probe team.
