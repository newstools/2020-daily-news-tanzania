POLICE in Shinyanga Region have warned the public against gender-based violence and other forms of crime against women and children. Police have said that between January and November, this year, nine men were imprisoned 30 years for defiling minors. The incidents took place in Kishapu District. Police Gender Desk head, Assistant Inspector of Police Rose Mbwambo made the revelation over the weekend during the commemoration of the 16-Days against violence. She said the police force will not hesitate to take serious measures against people abusing children. “As of last month, about 91 sexual abuse cases were reported in the Kishapu, with 43 (out of 91) cases being taken to the court. However, we still lack collaboration from the community since many of these cases are resolved at the family level,” she said. She said the situation hinders efforts against genderbased violence and perpetrators get a loophole to escape the arm of the law. She added that GBV acts have serious health, economic and psychological negative impacts to the victims and the nation at large. Kishapu District Commissioner Ms Nyabaganga Talaba said that superstitious beliefs were a serious threat and one of the reasons behind an increase in sexual violence cases in the area. She added that there is also failure by parents to recognize the position and contribution of girl child to the country’s development. “The government in collaboration with various stakeholders will continue intensifying public education campaigns against gender violence and ensure stern measures are taken against the culprits,” she said.
