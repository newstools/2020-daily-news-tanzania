THE Tarime/Rorya Regional Road Safety Department (Traffic) has collected 59,130,000/- in fines for various road safety offences. Tarime/Rorya Road Safety Unit Head (RTO) Ally Shaali said that the department had also provided education to all stakeholders and road users to reduce road accidents. He said between September and November this year, the department recorded 2,231 road safety offences some of which 1,971 offences resulted in 59m/- fines and other offenders were arraigned. He said one of the strategies to reduce road accidents in the district was to impose special markings on offenders’ licences so that those, who continued committing offences risked the termination of their licences as they were categorised as serial and dangerous road traffic offenders. “Plans are underway to place special marks on their licences (drivers) and those who commit serious and dangerous offences will have their licences revoked and they will not be allowed to operate fire engines,” said Mr Shaali. He noted that frequent road accidents, especially on Sirari-Mwanza Road, included drivers and road users not complying with road safety regulations and rules. “Some of the indicators of traffic violations include alcoholism, speeding and poor maintenance of vehicle and roads, including pedestrians not paying attention to road signs,” he said.
