IHEFU head coach Zuberi Katwila has said that they played under pressure to maintain their 2-1 home win over Kagera Sugar in their Mainland Premier league date at Sokoine Stadium in Mbeya. Katwila secured his first win out of two for the unimpressive Ihefu that had a miserable performance in the 14 outings to move up just one place after earning as little as 10 points from 14 matches. They lost nine matches and drew four times. Their win has enabled them to leapfrog Mwadui FC, who were recently punished 5-0 by Young Africans, moving from 18th to the 17th position. “I’m pleased with the victory, but I also respect a lot our opponents because they are highly spirited, above of us in the standing (11th place) with a desire to maintain their record,” said Katwila. “What we did is to capitalise on our opponents’ weakness to score goals” he said. His counterpart, Mecky Mexime also showered praise on their opponents, saying that they deserved the victory. Ihefu dominated the game by creating more chances but could not utilise them well. They earned their goals through Joseph Kinyozi (38th minute) and Issa Ngoah (54th minute). Kagera Sugar’s consolation goal came from Saadat Mohammed in the 60th minute.
