US President-elect Joe Biden delivered a forceful attack on President Donald Trump's barrage of lawsuits and claims of electoral fraud – demanding in a prime-time speech Monday that the 'will of the people' be honored. Biden spoke from Wilmington, Delaware hours after his win in the Electoral College became official and he passed the 270 Electoral Vote threshold. His speech was not a victory lap, but rather an effort to establish his own legitimacy while calling out Trump's relentless effort to overturn the results in his strongest attack on the sitting president since winning the election last month. 'Respecting the will of the people is at the heart of our democracy, even if we find those results hard to accept,' said Biden – alluding to Trump's refusal to concede or accept the results. Clearing his hoarse throat repeatedly, Biden teed off on the Trump campaign's repeated legal defeats, and pointed to Friday's devastating decision by the Supreme Court. 'The Trump campaign brought dozens and dozens of legal challenges .. they were heard again and again. And each of the times they were heard they were found to be without merit,' he said. He noted his own Electoral College win equaled Trump's, and at the time, 'President Trump called the electoral college tally a landslide. By his own standards these numbers represented a clear victory then, and I respectfully suggest they do so now.'
