DAR ES SALAAM Institute of Technology (DIT), Mwanza Campus, will introduce diploma courses in leather processing technology and food processing technology in the 2021/2022 academic year. The Campus Director Dr Albert Mmari disclosed this yesterday during a two-day consultative stakeholders workshop for reviewed curricula for Ordinary Diploma in Leather Technology and developed curricula for Ordinary Diploma in Leather Processing Technology, which drew various stakeholders. “Tanzania ranks number two on livestock population in Africa, behind Ethiopia. The 40 per cent of all livestock population in our country is in the Lake zone, but lots of skins go unutilised due to lack of enough experts for advanced leather processing activities,” said Dr Mmari. He further revealed that introduction of the new courses was part of the implementation of a-USD 75m East Africa Skill for Transformation and Regional Integration (EASTRIP) project, aimed at, among other things, producing competent skilled technicians from technical colleges, to fill the existence gap in various sectors of production. A-five year project (from last year), under sponsorship of the World Bank is implemented at the National Institute of Transport (NIT), Arusha Technical College as well as at both DIT main (Dar es Salaam) and Mwanza campuses. According to Dr Mmari, the newly introduced courses will boost students’ enrollment at DIT Mwanza Campus, from the current 100 plus to 750. However, Dr Mmari praised Tanzanians whose understanding on the importance of the leather/skin sector has increased as time goes on. A retired leather technologist Mr Keneth Boma commented that Tanzania is in a good position to grab international leather products markets. He said that skin quality depends much on how the product is preserved soon after an animal has been slaughtered. “There are various skin preservation methods, but the following three are a must: dry salting, wet-salting and air dry preparations,” he said.
