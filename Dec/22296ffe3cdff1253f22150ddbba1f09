Ghana's President Nana Akufo-Addo has been re-elected after a tightly contested election on Monday, BBC reports. The incumbent President Akufo-Addo garnered 51.6% of the vote, compared with 47.4% won by his main rival, ex-President John Mahama, according to official results. However, BBC reports that Mr Mahama has not yet conceded defeat. It was the third time the two politicians had faced each other in a presidential election. Ghana has a reputation for being one of the most stable democracies in Africa. Results in the parliamentary elections have yet to be announced, but are expected to be very close as well.
