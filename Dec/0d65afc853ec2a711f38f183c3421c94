THE government, through the Tanzania Agricultural Research Institute (Tari), has embarked on a research project to ensure high quality barley and wheat seeds in the country. This was revealed by Minister for Agriculture, Prof Adolf Mkenda, when addressing barley and wheat farmers in Matadi Ward, Siha District. “High crop yield is all about having high quality seeds. This will increase farmers’ incomes in the future,” he noted. He also assured farmers that the government would ensure they got reliable markets and prices for their produce. “The government is working hard to ensure barley and wheat farmers access reliable markets and good prices for their produce before exporting it. This will assure them of reliable incomes,” he added. The minister further warned large-scale farmers who changed land use through different agreements, saying they risked losing their land for contravening terms and conditions. “The government gives priority to the cultivation of wheat and barley. If those, who applied for land to grow wheat and barley are not using it as intended, it will be taken back from them and be given to other people who can grow wheat and barley,” he warned.
