MSALALA District will spend 32m/- for reproductive health public campaigns, it has been revealed here. District Medical Officer Dr Ntanwa Kilagwile revealed this at a recent workshop on Health System Advocacy (HSA), which was sponsored by Amref. “This budget is for the 2020/2021 financial year. Health service providers will be visiting community members for reproductive health sessions.  We are thankful that the budget has increased from 4.9m/- in 2019 /2020 to 32m/-,” said Dr Kilagwile. Acting Shinyanga Regional Administrative Secretary Mr Timothy Sosoma said that reproductive health education, especially on family planning was of paramount importance as statistics show that 21.3 per cent of the region’s population use contraception. “The government has invested a lot in this area as we can see tremendous progress. However, we are still facing some challenges, including shortage of health personnel, medicines and equipment. We are trying our best to use the available resources to meet the target” said Mr Sosoma. HAS Project Supervisor Mr Josiah Temba said that 232 members from health centres’ supervision committees have benefited from the training programme, whose focus was on improving health services at their workplaces. The project is also focusing on the improvements of administration and supervision of financial resources in the health sector. Mwamboku village chairman in Kishapu District Mr Chagu Washa thanked the government and stakeholders for the provision of reproductive health education in the area. “However, more efforts are still needed, especially in areas of child spacing as many couples are still ignorant on this matter,” he said. Ms Mektrida Lenatus, who has 10 children, was among reproductive education beneficiaries. She admitted to have challenges in taking care of the children due to lack of family planning and nutrition education.
