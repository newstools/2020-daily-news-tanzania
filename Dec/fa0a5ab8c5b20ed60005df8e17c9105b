THE Deputy Minister for Livestock and Fisheries, Ms Pauline Gekul has ordered Council Directors to set aside 15 per cent of funds accrued from the livestock and fisheries activities for improving the sector. Ms Gekul issued the directive while speaking to Mwanga District leaders in Kilimanjaro Region on Wednesday, noting that the requirement is in line with the 2002 Government Circular regarding the sectors. According to her, the government issued the particular circular in 2002 for the improvement of the livestock and fisheries sector including rehabilitation of dipping trough, auctions and the procurement of vaccines. “Implementation of the circular will go up the year 2025, therefore the Council Directors need to familiarise with its requirement to help strengthen service delivery with regard to our livestock in obtaining good produce,” said Ms Gekul. She observed that majority of the infrastructure in connection to livestock keeping are worn out. Ms Gekul cited another loophole as lack of fences around cattle auction centres, which in turn leads to loss of revenues in the councils due to little management of the areas. However, she admitted that at times such councils also experience shortage of funds, but it was important to uphold discipline managing their expenditures. Ms Gekul said if the council adhere to proper principles of managing their funds, it will ease the process of making improvement in the two sectors, stressing that the officials should be keen on implementing the orders. She expressed the government’s commitment on improving all dipping trough, auction centres as well as on ensuring that vaccines are easily accessible to relieve people from any hustles while caring for their livestock. Equally, the deputy minister urged livestock officers to oversee and supervise government revenues’ collections and minimise losses, adding that once the collection is good, services will be improved.
