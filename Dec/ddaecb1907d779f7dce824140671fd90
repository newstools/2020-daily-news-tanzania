YOUNG Africans will be looking to maintain their sky-rocket leap in the Premier League when they face Ruvu Shooting in a tricky match at Benjamin Mkapa Stadium today. The victory will see Yanga knocking 34 points at the helm of the league table from 13 games played, hence; all eyes will be at them to see if they can manage that against the strong opponents. Until now, Yanga is the only team that has conceded a few goals (4) than any other side on the log while scoring 15 goals in the process. The encounter is set to be the last for Yanga at home before the elapse of the first round as they have shifted their next home game against Dodoma FC to Sheikh Amri Abeid Stadium in Arusha. This means that after their next game against Mwadui to be played in Shinyanga, they will proceed to Arusha to face Dodoma before travelling to Mbeya to take on Ihefu and later the squad will go to Sumbawanga for their second round duel against Tanzania Prisons. On the other hand, Ruvu Shooting are among the transformed teams this season especially when playing against the big names like Simba, Azam and Yanga. They have already snatched maximum three points from the defending champions Simba as such, they are willing to use the same razor blade against the current league leaders and become the first team this season to surprise Yanga. Ruvu Shooting sit fourth on the table with 23 points, similar to Simba but the latter have three more games in hand to play hence, they have a possible 9 points to harvest from the three duels. However, speaking prior to the match, Ruvu Shooting’s Information Officer Masau Bwire said the only way to be respected in the Vodacom Premier League is to beat the so called big teams Simba and Yanga. “One of them (Simba) who seemed to be a bit tough was already outclassed and we are now focusing on the next opponent of whom I am sure that we will also defeat him,” Bwire said.
