WAY back in 2014 Liberius Yamkana, 35, a resident of Biharamulo Districtâ€™s Nyakahura Ward needed about 100,000/- to send his children to school. Like any other farmer, he approached a neighbour identified as Paulo Madoshi who lended him the money but with strict conditions that instead of returning the money he should repay him 12 bags of rice the following season. Unfortunately, the weather was unfavourable and Yamkana managed to repay him four bags of rice worth 1,400,000/-. To his surprise, the lender (Madoshi ) increased the number of bags to 18. During 2016 Mr Yamkana managed to repay him six bags of millet worth 420,000/-, but he was informed that the amount had again increased to 32 bags worth 2.7m/- . The following season Yamkana managed to repay 300,000/- before abandoning his family to an unknown destination. The matter was recently reported to the Prevention and Combating of Corruption Bureau (PCCB), who took swift action. Kagera Regional PCCB Chief John Joseph said the suspect, Madoshi, was helping in the investigations while the seven-acre farm had already been returned to Mr Yamkana who has also returned home and was now living a happy life with his wife and six children. Mr Joseph strongly warned people who engaged in such malpractices that they would be prosecuted. Meanwhile, PCCB has arraigned two officers in Muleba District, including a ward Executive Officer for allegedly soliciting a 7,000/- bribe.
