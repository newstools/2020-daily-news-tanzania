Tourists travel at Nairobi National Park in Nairobi, capital of Kenya, on Oct. 18, 2020. (Xinhua/Li Yan) Tourist arrivals through all points of entry to Kenya dropped by 72 percent to 470,971 in the first ten months to October compared to 1.72 million arrivals in the same period in 2019, a government official said. Najib Balala, Tourism and Wildlife Cabinet secretary said a near-total collapse of international arrivals occurred between April to July due to the travel restrictions, and then a slight improvement took place after the resumption of international flights in August. Balala said the east African nation experienced a good performance for January and February followed by a drastic decline in March due to the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic globally. “We are not out of the woods yet, but we are optimistic the situation will gradually improve once the vaccines being developed become readily available to the masses,” he said in a statement issued in Nairobi. “The whole world will be safe only when everybody is vaccinated. So we should encourage the mass distribution of the vaccines once they are ready without discrimination,” he added.
