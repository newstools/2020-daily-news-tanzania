The United Kingdom has become the first country in the world to approve the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine for widespread use, BBC reports. According to the news, the UK regulator, MHRA, has approved the immunisation saying it is safe for rollout next week. The vaccine offers up to 95% protection against Covid-19 illness, read BBC website. Immunisations, according to the authority, could start within days for those who need it the most, such as elderly people in care homes. It is said that UK has already ordered 40m doses to vaccinate 20 million people. Around 10 million doses should be available soon, with the first 800,000 arriving in the UK in the coming days. It is the fastest ever vaccine to go from concept to reality, taking only 10 months to follow the same developmental steps that normally span a decade. "Help is on its way," tweeted UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock on Wednesday. NHS Chief Executive, Sir Simon Stevens, said the health service was preparing for "the largest-scale vaccination campaign in our country's history".
