NGARA Farmers’ Cooperative Union (NFCU) has incurred a 705m/- loss in three years due to lack of a coffee processing plant. NFCU Acting General Manager Zephania Mnyonyela said due to lack of a coffee processing plant, farmers were threshing coffee produce manually. “This has negatively affected both the quality and quantity of produce. Instead, each farmer was being charged 200/- for threshing a kilogramme of coffee,” he said. He noted that he said plans were underway to secure a 600m/- loan from the Tanzania Agricultural Development Bank (TADB) and procure a modern coffee processing plant. Kagera Regional Administrative Secretary (RAS), Prof Faustin Kamuzora revealed that the region produced an average of 21,000 metric tonnes of coffee annually. Coffee is grown in Bukoba, Muleba, Karagwe, Kyerwa, Ngara and Missenyi districts in the Lake Zone.  This constitutes 30 per cent of the total coffee production in Tanzania. However, for quite a long time average production stood at 0.32kg per tree due to lack of  proper management  while most of the coffee trees are over 60 years old. Key challenges experienced by smallholder farmers include poor extension services, high costs of inputs, adulterated inputs, low coffee price and minimum level of engagement of the youth in coffee production. Other challenges are poor institutional support, poor marketing systems and climate change effects. All these challenges have contributed to low coffee productivity, poor coffee quality, low farm gate prices and coffee racketeering.
