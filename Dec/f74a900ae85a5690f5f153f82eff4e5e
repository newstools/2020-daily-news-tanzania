A GROUP of 49 people is on a special task to climb Mount Kilimanjaro as part of marking the 59th independence anniversary today. The group – including retired members of the Tanzania People’s Defence Forces (TPDF), journalists and some workers and members of the Tanzania National Parks (TANAPA Board of Directors started hiking the Africa’s rooftop on Monday. Moshi District Commissioner Mr Rajab Kundya commended TPDF for its initiative to have some members hike the mountain every year during the independence anniversary of the country boasting of tremendous progress, peace and tranquility. This year’s theme in climbing Kili is “Mount Kilimanjaro is Safe, Climb While in Tanzania”, seeking to assure foreigners and locals alike, that the country is safe in spite of other countries still struggling to contain the Covid-19 pandemic. Mr Kundya hailed TANAPA for scooping many international awards, but called upon its leaders and workers not to be carried away, but instead they should put more efforts in getting more tourists to different destinations in the country so that the record is retained and more awards pour in. Senior Conservation Commissioner – Northern Zone -- Mr Herman Batiho, speaking on behalf of the Deputy Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Natural Resources and Tourism, Conservation Commissioner Dr Alan Kijazi, pledged to keep working hard. He called upon the climbers to be good ambassadors and promote the world’s highest freestanding mountain within and outside the country. He added that TANAPA would stand by its obligations to safeguard the tourist attractions in the country. The event is marked by placing Tanzanian Flag on the top of Mount Kilimanjaro. The group is led by Colonel Martin Msumari as it was done way back in 1961 by the late Alexander Nyirenda. Since the outbreak of Covid-19, Tanzania took precautionary steps in all sectors. In June 1, the government launched a Tourism Season by introducing Standard Operating Procedures.
