THE Hubert Kairuki Memorial University (HKMU) has said it has survived and continued with classes as usual during the Covid-19 pandemic this year, thanks to utilising modern technology. This was said in Dar es Salaam yesterday by HKMU Vice-Chancellor, Prof Charles Mgone, at the 18th graduation ceremony. He said despite all difficulties during the pandemic they did all they could do and continued with their daily timetable of teaching by using information communication technology (ICT). “The use of internet is not new to us because even before the pandemic we were prepared to offer education and do all our activities through ICT. We would like to thank God and government leaders who led us through this difficult time,” he said. He added that the university had also continued with its programmes to sponsor its staff to pursue further studies, including masters and PhDs in and outside the country. Prof Mgone noted that currently the university had 15 lecturers studying PhD courses and seven tutorial assistants pursuing masters’ degree courses. According to Prof Mgone, the university is also focusing on research and at the moment a number of studies are conducted on communicable and non-communicable diseases. HKMU Board Chairperson Kokushubila Kairuki applauded the HKMU for recording roaring success in the health sector, saying their efforts had contributed to sustainable national development.
