Inspector Mwasabeja further said during that period there were 44 fire incidents in schools, causing several deaths and destruction of school infrastructure. According to him, investigations established that many of the fire incidences were caused by negligence, sabotage and electrical faults. In schools, he said, investigations found out that many students were charging their mobile phones and using heaters and ironing their clothes while at school and using devices that were not in a proper electrical system. On solutions to incidents, Inspector Mwasabeja said FRF had entered an agreement with the Tanzania Scouts Association (TSA) to provide education in schools on disaster preparedness especially fire accidents.
