GEITA Gold Mine (GGM) has set aside a 76m/- budget for a road safety public education project to fight against road accidents. Speaking during the launch of the project mid-this week, GGM Senior Public Relations Officer for External Companies Manase Ndoroma said the idea came about after realising that there was lack of road safety education which he said was one of the causes of most road accidents. "We will collaborate with the Police Force and will start with the district council staff. The budget, therefore, is for lecturer allowance, teaching facilities and other important equipment. "We are doing this to curb road accidents. There is no community wellbeing in the presence of regular road accidents. The nourishment of society is the nourishment of our business because road safety and people's safety are part of our successes," said Mr Manase Not only that, but also over 95 per cent of GGM staff and their families live in Geita Urban District, hence they should experience road safety while on mining sites, according to Mr Manase. Regional Traffic Officer (RTO) Swalehe Digega said the project was for all road users, including people with disabilities, motorcyclists, cyclists and pedestrians in the region. The RTO added that public education was for effective law enforcement to reduce road accidents impacts, including deaths, injuries and destruction of property and infrastructure. Motorcyclists Association Chairperson Daniel Dotto commended the idea and assured stakeholders of cooperation of all motorcyclists in the region.
