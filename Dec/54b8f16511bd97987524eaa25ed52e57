THE Dar es Salaam Regional Commissioner Abubakar Kunenge has encouraged city residents to use the holiday seasons to visit the city’s attractions in order to boost domestic tourism. The country’s largest commercial city is a home for attractive historical sites, conferences and events tourism, medical and arts and culture. “I call upon residents in this region to use the festive season visit various attractions like beaches, hotels, conference buildings for enjoyment and recreational services,” Mr Kunenge said after officiating the 16 days Circus Mama Africa Exhibitions which kicked off this week in the city. Mr Kunege described further that on the medical tourism; there are a number of hospitals in the city, which are not only serving Tanzanians but also from neighboring countries, which makes it another important source of revenues. “Government has invested heavily in specialised medical services like training health professionals, improving health facilities like Muhimbili National Hospital, Jakaya Kikwete Cardiac Institute and Ocean Road Cancer Institute. These are attracting big number of people, including foreigners, signifying the growth of medical tourism.” He therefore persuaded young people to join various artists’ works like circus mama Africa, which is one way of creating jobs and advertising the country’s tourism attractions. On her part, the Executive Director of the Tanzania Tourist Board (TTB) Ms Devotha Mdachi called upon Tanzanians to visit the ongoing circus exhibition in which Tanzanian youth are showing their mastery of art and also earning a living. “Youth are training just here in Dar es salaam, I call for them to join the training as Tanzanians have shown strength in this arts for years now,” said Winston Ruddle, Circus Mama Africa Founder
