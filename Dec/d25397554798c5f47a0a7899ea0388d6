Geita regional authorities have eradicated cases of albino killings while reducing elderly killings by 95 per cent, Regional Police Commander, SACP Henry Mwaibambe has said. He said the reason behind the success lies in sensitizing the public, including stepping up security, a task that is carried out in partnership with other security organs in the region. "We educated members of the public on the consequences of the acts, including addressing wrong beliefs that seemed to propel the killings. As a result, majority of residents joined us in the fight against the evil practice,” the RPC said. He said as a result of the sensitisation campaigns plus increased security, people in the region have been volunteering information upon sensing suspicious acts. He said that the police created a network for quick arrest of the culprits, adding that the network made it possible in the arrest of several culprits. Regional Commissioner (RC), Engineer Robert Gabriel commented that another source of the killings was shortage of scientific health services, wherein people prioritised witchcraft. Improvements in the health sector therefore changed the people's mindset and helped in abandoning their wrong beliefs, stressed the RC. "The government has built a good number of dispensaries and health centres, with services close to people, which solved their problems. They no longer visit the witch doctors,” said Engineer Gabriel. Early this month when Minister of State in the President's Office for Good Governance, Mr George Mkuchika visited the region, he expressed his gratitude to security organs for a successful war against the killings in all Lake Zone regions. He said that elderly and albino killings appeared to be a serious threat in the regions, adding that it has now remained history, urging relevant organs to further tighten security to maintain the current situation.
