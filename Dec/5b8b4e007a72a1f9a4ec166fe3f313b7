GOVERNMENT Chemist Laboratory Authority (GCLA) has called upon doctors to observe principles and guidelines on how to collect and handle samples that are required to undergo DNA or forensic testing at GCLA. GCLA made a call yesterday when speaking to the fifth-year medical students at Kilimanjaro Christian Medical University College (KCMC) in Kilimanjaro Region. GCLA Director of Forensic Science David Elias reiterated the call to medical students at the college during training in sample handling. Training was organised by GCLA. Mr Elias noted that doctors were key stakeholders of GCLA in conducting laboratory tests for forensic matters and DNA. Therefore, Mr Elias argued such training was part of reminding doctors about their responsibilities at health facilities. GCLA took an initiative to train medical students to prepare them with necessary knowledge and skills to apply them in the workplace. The students were trained what to consider when collecting, storing and transporting samples for testing at GCLA. “Training aims at reminding ourselves and building awareness on how to handle samples,” he said, noting that doctors were key people to ensure samples maintained required quality for laboratory testing and accurate results. During training medical students were taken through laws and regulations guiding issues of sample handling. A leader of students who attended training, Mr Simon Matajiri, thanked GCLA for the training workshop he said had given them more knowledge on how to handle samples. He expressed optimism that the knowledge and skills from training would be useful for practising their profession.
