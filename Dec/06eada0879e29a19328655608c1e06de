Uganda on Sunday banned all public New Year Eve festivities over surging COVID-19 infections in the country, a top government official said. Judith Nabakooba, minister of information, communications, technology and national guidance, said in a statement that all music concerts, overnight prayers and fireworks displays have been cancelled due to the novel coronavirus. “This gathering and funfair increase the risk of spreading COVID-19,” said Nabakooba. “Police will not give any permission for fireworks this time. Fireworks are usually accompanied by people staying up late and gathering people around a particular place,” she said. The minister urged the public to stay home and welcome the New Year with family members. As of Saturday, Uganda had registered 33,563 COVID-19 cases, 11,055 recoveries and 245 deaths since the index case was recorded on March 21, according to the ministry of health.
