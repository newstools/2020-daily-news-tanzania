The EU and UK have reached a post-Brexit trade deal, ending months of disagreements over fishing rights and future business rules. Uk Downing Street said: "We have got Brexit done and we can now take full advantage of the fantastic opportunities available to us". It comes after days of wrangling in Brussels. In a press conference in Brussels, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said: "This was a long and winding road but we have finally got a deal."
