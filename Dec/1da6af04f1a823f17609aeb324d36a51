MINISTER for Home Affairs George Simbachawene has urged employees in the ministry to be patriotic and help promote peace and security in the country. “The Police Force and the Immigration Services Department are key units for the national security,” he said, warning that any negligence among the two state organs could cost the country. "You should not agree to be a rubber stamp," the minister said yesterday at a session with the ministry workers’ union. He said it was every person’s responsibility to maintain peace and security. He told the workers’ council that it had also to ensure accountability among civil servants. "This council is not established to only demand for a better working environment among the staff, but also help the government in its quest for sustainable development," he said. The minister noted that the government on the other hand had continued releasing funds for the ministry to motivate the employees. He hailed the security organs for effectiveness in overseeing the general election which was peacefully held in the country on October 28. "For this, I commend Inspector-General of Police Simon Sirro for ensuring the electoral process went well from the beginning to the end," he said. He urged the management to familiarise with the ruling CCM election manifesto as well as President John Magufuli’s inaugural speech he delivered in Parliament last month. Deputy Minister for Home Affairs Khamis Hamza Khamis called for support from all workers in the ministry to help champion the vision and government plans. The deputy minister said he was new in the ministry and expected support that would help discharge his duties as expected.
