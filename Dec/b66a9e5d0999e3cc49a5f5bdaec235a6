THE Embassy of China in Tanzania this week donated 90 sets of lecture desks and chairs to help National College of Tourism (NCT) upgrade its facilities. Chinese Ambassador to Tanzania Wang Ke and Dr Shogo Mlozi Sedoyeka, Chief Executive Officer of NCT signed a handover certificate for the donation at the Chinese Embassy. “Tanzania is rich in tourism resources and we’re happy to see the rapid development in Tanzania’s tourism sector. China attaches great importance to tourism cooperation between the two countries,” Ms Ke said. She said in recent years, tourism cooperation between the two parties had been continuously strengthened. Providing statistics Ms Ke said the number of Chinese tourists visiting Tanzania in 2019 had exceeded 35,000 and she was convinced that there was a possibility for Chinese tourist arrivals to grow further in the post-Covid-19 period. “The embassy is willing to strengthen friendly relations between NCT and tourism colleges in China and promote exchanges and training of tourism talents between the parties,” said Ms Ke. For his part, Dr Sedoyeka thanked the Chinese Embassy for support. “We’re facing difficulties such as insufficiency of teaching equipment. The donated lecture desks and chairs will be put into use at our new campus in Mwanza to benefit teachers and students there,” Dr Sedoyeka said. “I spent four years studying in China and obtained my doctorate degree. I love China and the Chinese people and look forward to closer bilateral exchanges and fruitful tourist cooperation that will deepen the friendly relations,” Dr Sedoyeka added.
