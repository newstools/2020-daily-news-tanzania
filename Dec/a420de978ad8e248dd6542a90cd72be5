A Namibian politician named after Adolf Hitler has said he has no plans for world domination after winning a sweeping victory in local elections, according to BBC. Adolf Hitler Uunona was recently elected as councillor for the Ompundja constituency. Quoted by German newspaper Bild in an exclusive interview, the politician insisted he had "nothing to do" with Nazi ideology. Adolf, like other Germanic first names, is not uncommon in the country, which was once a German colony. He was elected for the ruling Swapo party, which led the campaign against colonial and white-minority rule.
