THE Kilimanjaro Association of Spinal cord Injuries (KASI) members have asked employers in the country to consider them in job opportunities as a way to take them out of poverty. The appeal was made in Dar es Salaam recently by the KASI General Secretary, Abdulazizi Shambe in an event to receive various items donated to them by Meridian Bet. Statistics show that there are 4.2 million people living with disabilities in Tanzania and are among the poorest and most marginalised in the society. He said the association has more than 1,300 members countrywide and some of them are educated, but can not secure jobs because of their physical disabilities in the labour market. “We have drivers, teachers, and journalists and football coach with class B obtained from European Football Associations (UEFA),” he said. However, he thanked Meridian Bet for their support calling upon other organisations to emulate and support them in their health problems. On his part, the Meridian Bet Operation Manager, Carlo Njatu said they decided to support the people with spinal cord problems so as to give them comfort and enable their association reach others. Some of the items donated by the betting firm included maize flour, sugar and cooking oil. People living with spinal cord damages and other disabilities are often among the poorest and most marginalised in society and in particular, the spinal cord injuries has made millions of them to become poor in the job market, hence there is a need to do something about it. According to the People with Disabilities Act 2010, specifically, article 31 requires employers to hire and maintain the employment of people living with disabilities. On the strength, it establishes a work force quota under where every employer with a workforce of 20 or more must employ a person(s) living with disabilities.
