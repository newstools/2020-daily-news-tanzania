FORMER Prime Minister Mizengo Pinda today presides over the Ethics and Human Rights Day in which the government says it has made strides in promoting human rights in the country. Minister of State President’s Office Public Service Management and Good Governance Mr George Mkuchika announced here on Wednesday that improved use of public resources coupled with an increase in integrity among civil servants has stimulated socio-economic growth. “The government is committed towards improving welfare,” he said, when he briefed reporters on the Ethics Day commemorated on December 10. The day was a result of blended two international events: Anti-Corruption Day and Human Rights Day. “Good governance, human rights, and the fight against corruption should be an ongoing issue as it is the basis for service delivery that meets the expectations of the public,” he said. The newly-appointed minister said the government has indicated solid political will towards the fight against corruption. As a result, he said there have been improvements in service delivery -- especially health and education. He said the government’s decision to support children from disadvantaged homes to freely access basic education is part of promoting human rights in the country. Since 2016, the government adopted guidelines and instruments for both public and private institutions to enforce a high-level of anti-corruption measures. According to reports from the ministry, the government will be holding a nation workshop to deliberate on the challenges and way forward in which key speakers including the former Controller and Auditor-General Mr Ludovick Utouh have confirmed attendance. On the other development, the Minister called on the media to be ambassadors of works done by the government.
