DAR ES SALAAM City residents are set to win various items during this festive season after the GSM Malls launched initiative that will among others promote tourism in the country. The company’s Chief Commercial Officer Mr. Allan Chonjo said apart from the prizes, customers will get opportunity for a fully paid tourism trip to Ngorongoro Conservative Area in Arusha. “As you know, this year has been a difficult one for many people especially after the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic which paralysed many things economically and socially. “Upon realising that, we at GSM saw it potential to begin this promotion so that people should be able to win various products they dreamed to own from GSM and make them happy by fulfilling their dreams,” he said. He added that every person will stand a chance of joining the promotion by being given a coupon whenever he or she buys a furniture from GSM Home and GSM Retail worth over 1m/-. According to him, the biggest reward they have reserved to the lucky winner is that a team of decoration experts from GSM will transform the interior looks of his or her house to make it more beautiful than ever before.
