Tanzania Postal Corporation (TPC) has invited entrepreneurs to register for free at their online shopping so that they can sell their products easily while customers get free delivered without inconvenience. Speaking on Monday at ongoing industrial exhibition for local produce at Mwalimu Julius Nyerere grounds in Dar es Salaam, the TPC online Business Manager, Amina Salim said the service will increase productivity. She said the online store is called Posta Shop Tanzania, ready for registering entrepreneurs and various traders with their products including Tanzanians and those from abroad “So far the organization has registered 90 customers in our network and soon the store will be officially launched and I believe it will help many business people especially small entrepreneurs,” said Salim. In addition, Salim said the organization wants to cooperate with TANTRADE in order to find more stakeholders who are also from abroad in Tanzania. She said many retailers have nowhere to sell their products so the shop will also make it easier for customers as they can buy products from home. “The Tanzania Postal Corporation sells and sends the money to the trader and then sends to customers in their homes as soon as they buy the goods,” she said. She said the benefits of the shop reduce inconvenience to the public as instead of spending a lot of time to go for shopping. “Through the store, citizens will buy different products at the same time and pay for them right there they are and the Post Office will bring you anywhere,” she said.
