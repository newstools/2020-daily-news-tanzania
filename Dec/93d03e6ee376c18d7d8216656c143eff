DAR ES SALAAM Regional Commissioner Abubakar Kunenge has urged the residents to build a culture of visiting exhibitions that promote domestic tourism, and explore the opportunities available in the industry. He made the remark shortly after visiting the preparation of Mama Africa circus, which is organised by Tanzania Tourist Board (TTB) and CI group Limited aimed at using the circus in promoting domestic tourism. “The exhibition is scheduled to be held tomorrow (today) which gives young Tanzanians an opportunity to promote tourism in a different way. “As Dar es salaam we are well organised and ensure peace is maintained in this exhibition, as well as in holiday’s season,” he said. The RC called on the public to abide by the rules and regulations towards this festive season as security organs are ready to counter any incidences aimed at destabilising peace in the city. TTB Managing Director, Ms Devota Mdachi said the exhibition aims to promote domestic tourism through the Mama Africa circus exhibition, which will involve various people in the tourism industry. “We believe through this exhibition the tourism business will stay and our primary role is to ensure that Tanzania continues to be heard globally,” she said. The Mama Africa Group is using circus in promoting domestic tourism in the different countries. She added that the first demonstration would be held today, which will include journalists, celebrities, musicians, and politicians. Moreover, on Thursday they will open the doors to the public to taste the circus. Mama Africa circus is a circus group that includes young Tanzanians trained from Bagamoyo College. “This group will be in the country for two weeks, we expect many people to come to see this exhibition and explore different opportunities which are found in the tourism sector,” she said.
