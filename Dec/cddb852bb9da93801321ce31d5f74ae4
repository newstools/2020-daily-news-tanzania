THE Chinese embassy in Tanzania on Wednesday donated medical equipment worth more than 30mil/- to Vijibweni Hospital in Dar es Salaam. The equipment included delivery kits, wheelchairs, hemoglobin photometers, and infrared thermometer. Chinese Ambassador to Tanzania, Ms Wang Ke stressed that their government attaches importance to the development of local medical treatment and public health in Tanzania, and expressed the embassyâ€™s readiness to render assistance within its capacity for the benefit of Tanzanian. Dar es Salaam Regional Commissioner, Mr Abubakar Kunenge extended appreciation to the Chinese embassy for its support in all fields, especially health service, and noted that the friendship and kindness behind these gifts means a lot to the people of Dar es Salaam. Since China sent out its first medical team to Africa in 1963, China has exerted all means to assist Africa, including building medical institutions, providing medicines and medical devices, organizing training sessions, and offering scholarships to assist Africa's health infrastructure building, capacity building and talent training. Medical and health cooperation between China and Tanzania began in 1964 and 1968 when the Chinese government started sending medical teams to Zanzibar and Tanzania mainland. This year is critical to the bilateral relationship between Tanzania and China, as they celebrate 55 years since the signing of the Friendship Treaty between Tanzania and China in 1965. Since the signing of the treaty five decades ago, China has provided a helping hand to Tanzania in implementing various projects in all fields, including health, defence and security, agriculture, infrastructure, education and industrial sectors.
