THE High Court has ordered Snow Crest and Wildlife Safaris Limited to pay 200,000 US dollars (about 460m/- as compensation to J.S. Khambaita Limited, a company which constructed Snow Crest Arusha-based five stars hotel. Judge Kassim Robert ruled against Snow Crest and Wildlife Safaris Limited, who was defendant in the suit, after partly allowing a suit lodged by J.S. Khambaita Limited, the plaintiff in the matter. The judge noted that the contract entered by the parties on December 30, 2014 imposed an obligation on the part of the defendant to pay a sum of 200,000 US dollars payable in two equal installments. According to him, the first installment was supposed to be paid on or before January 28, 2015 whereas the second installment was supposed to be paid on or before December 31, 2015. It is noted also that the defendant was required to perform her respective promise under the contract as required under section 37(1) of the Law of Contract Ac. “Since (officials of the defendant) have admitted that the defendant did not pay the claimed amount and given that there is no evidence of payment of the said amount, the defendant is obviously in breach of the contract,” the judge said. He said that having the court decided that the defendant breached the contract in question, the plaintiff, as a party who suffered as a result of the said breach, was entitled to compensation for any loss or damage caused thereby as provided for under section 73(1) of the Law of Contract Act. The contract provided that payment of 200,000 US dollars by the defendant to the plaintiff marks the final and conclusive demand of 1,250,782,239/- demanded by the plaintiff as outstanding building costs. “In the circumstances, taking into account the terms of (the contract) and reliefs sought by the plaintiff, this court awards the plaintiff a sum of 200,000 US dollars as compensation for breach of contract entered between the plaintiff and defendant on December 30, 2014,” he ruled. The judge, however, rejected the other arguments on payment of balance of 1,250,782,239/-. According to him, it appears that the defendant could not oppose the existence of the contract between the plaintiff and the defendant entered on December 30, 2014. Nevertheless, he said, the defendant objected that the said contract does not modify the contract alleged to take place on February 26, 2006. Having looked at the contents of the contract dated December 30, 2014, the court was in agreement with the argument made by the defendant. The Plaintiff, J.S. Khambaita LTD, filed a suit in the High Court against the defendant, Snow crest Hotel and Wildlife Safaris Ltd, claiming for the sum of 1,460,757,531/- being the outstanding payment for construction of Snow Crest Hotel on Plot No. 39 and 58 Block BB Kwangulelo – Arusha. It was alleged that the plaintiff and defendant entered into a contract on February 26, 2006 in which the plaintiff undertook to construct a hotel for consideration of 2,752,017,257/-. The plaintiff discharged her contractual obligations and accomplished the construction on August 31, 2008 as agreed, but the Defendant failed to pay the plaintiff contrary to the agreement. In an attempt to settle the claims, the parties entered into agreement on December 30, 2014 and agreed, among others, to bargain the payments and reached to a conclusion that the hotel owner shall pay the builders the sum of 200,000 US dollars which shall be paid into two equal installments. Despite this agreement and letters of reminder from the Plaintiff and her Debt Collector Agent, ACR the defendant failed to pay the plaintiff. The defendant’s previous owners sued the current owners in the High Court of Tanzania, Commercial Division at Arusha. The current owners of the hotel were ordered to take all liabilities of Snow crest hotel and Wildlife Safaris Limited to M/S J.S Khambaita in construction of Snow crest hotel, thus the new owners were ordered pay to the said M/S Khambaita Limited a total of 200,000 US dollars as outstanding balance. As a result, the plaintiff claimed from the defendant 1,418,211,196/07, which the plaintiff said was approximated to 200,000 US dollars together with the interest thereon at the rate of 2 per cent per month from the respective due dates of invoices until payment in full but the defendant failed to pay.
