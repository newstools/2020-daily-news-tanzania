THE debt analysts are predicting a slight drop weighted average yield due to expected over subscription of a 15-year government bond today. The over subscription projection based on the fact that the demand for the short term government instrument is high thus lowering the yield rates. The government sought to borrow 122bn/- from the public with a coupon rate of 13.5 per cent per year in the next 15 years. The Tanzania Securities projected in its Weekly Market Blast that the instrument weighted average yields (WAY) to slight drop based on high appetite. “There could be slight drop in the WAY for the short term instruments due to over subscription as a result of high demand,” Tanzania Securities said. The last auction of a 15-year bond, three months ago, was oversubscribed by almost 90 per cent and sold at a premium price of 102/-. Zan Securities said in its Weekly Market Wrap-up that the bond expected to be oversubscribed due to high demand. “We expect the 15–year Treasury bond to oversubscribe in the [this] week’s auction,” Zan said. However, the latest bond auction fortnight 10 years, “in a change of scenery” was undersubscribed at 43.25per cent. “[The 10-year] Treasury bond auction…was undersubscribed, different from recent occurrences of significant appetite of Treasury bonds by the public,” Orbit Securities said. The weighted average price for successful bids went up by 31.77 bps to 100.0158/-. As a result, the weighted average yield to maturity went down by 2.3bps to 11.4686 per cent. Meanwhile, Orbit Securities said yesterday on its weekly market synopsis that a Treasury bills auction mid last week for 35 days tenor was oversubscribed by 100 per cent while the 364 days tenor was undersubscribed by 17.85per cent. While, the 91 days and 182 days tenors were fully subscribed. The total size offered by the Bank of Tanzania (BoT) was the usual 90.23bn/- while the tender size amounted to 76.14bn/-, marking a total under subscription rate of 15.6per cent. The central bank accepted a total of 63.4bn/-. The yield of the 35 days tenor remained similar to the previous auction while the 91 days and 182 days tenors gained 8bps and 3bps respectively. The 364 days on the other hand lost 12bps. The yields to maturities from the auction under review were 1.99 per cent, 2.50 per cent, 2.61 per cent and 4.23 per cent, for the 35 days, 91 days, 182 days and 364 days tenors respectively.
