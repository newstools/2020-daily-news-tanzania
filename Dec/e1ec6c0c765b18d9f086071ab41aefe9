A BUKOBA Municipal resident identified as Theonest Mujuni (47), was on Tuesday arraigned at Bukoba District Magistrate's court charged with publishing false information on Facebook. State Attorney Suzan Masule told the court that on November 16 this year, the accused (Mujuni), published false information on his Facebook account, claiming that the New MV Victoria ‘Hapa Kazi Tu” ship   was faulty and likely to cause fatalities. According to Ms Masule, the information was unfounded and was likely to cause a breach of  peace. When the charges were read to him, the accused pleaded not guilty. Resident Magistrate John Mpitanjia set bail conditions that the accused should sign a bail bond of 10m/- with two reliable sureties and adjourned the Criminal Case No 272/2020 until December 14, this year for another mention.
