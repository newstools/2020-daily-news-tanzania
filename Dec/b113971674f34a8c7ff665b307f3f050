DEPUTY Minister for Energy Steven Byabato has directed regional and district managers of Tanesco to avoid business as usual attitude, instead they should leave their offices and go to field to solve problems facing people. Equally, he directed them to set aside one day in a week to listen to customers’ grievances. Mr Byabato made the directive recently while addressing stakeholders in Bukoba Municipal Council. "For quite a long time, people have been complaining about delayed services by Tanesco to connect them to electricity. This attitude must change. Those who fail to deliver will not be tolerated," he warned. He announced that the time to connect a customer to electricity once payment was made would be 30-90 days. He also directed that people who had made their payments should be connected  to electricity by end of January next year. At least 887 customers in Kagera Region expect to be connected to electricity. Mr Byabato assured Tanzanians that the 5th phase government was determined to ensure all villages in the country were connected to electricity by the end of May next year. "This is practicable because all required equipment, including transformers, meters, concrete and utility poles and wires are locally manufactured and we have sufficient stock," he said. He reminded workers under his ministry of a popular slogan ‘speed, creativity and correctness’. "President John Magufuli has already announced that Tanzanians in rural areas will be connected to electricity after paying 27,000/-. This is a golden opportunity which should not be missed," he stressed. He further explained in five years (2015-2020) the number of villages connected to electricity in the country had increased from 2,018 villagers in 2016 to 9,889 in 2020, while to date the remaining villages stood at 2,021. He assured Tanzanians that the remaining 2,021 villages would be connected to electricity by the  end of May next year because the money was available.
