THE Teacher Service Commission (TSC) has insisted that the punishments given to teachers are not aimed at intimidating and inflicting pain on them, but are rather upholding ethics in the profession. TSC Acting Secretary Moses Chitama made the clarification recently while speaking to the media on teachers’ discipline and ethics as they discharge their duties. He asked the society to take the measures as part of instilling discipline in the profession, adding that there are stipulations in the law, which fight unprofessional conduct in teaching as a profession. According to him, teaching is a profession like any other and has its codes of conduct, guidelines and laws, adding that once violated, TSC becomes forced to take measures, which ensure that schools remain better places for children. “That is why teachers are undergoing training on ways of bringing up children they teach to become good citizens,” said Mr Chitama. Elaborating, he said grave ethics violation by any teacher is punishable and TSC will always be at the forefront fighting any malpractice in the profession. The acting Secretary said several initiatives are being used to raise teachers’ ethics, citing some as seminars and suspending some during pending investigations. He named other punishable acts as chronic absenteeism amongst some teachers, noting that a recent survey carried out by the commission discovered that some of them employed in public schools, still slip to teach in unauthorised institutions, despite being in the government payroll. “Based on this kind of behavior, the commission cannot stay quiet and keep on tolerating such grave misconduct like truancy and gender based violence… serious measure must be taken,” he added. However, he wondered why some parents are not meeting their responsibility of caring for their children, claiming to be busy, yet this is a collective responsibility.
