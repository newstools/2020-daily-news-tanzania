IT is unlawful for a person to collect and market metal waste without permit from the National Environment Management Council (NEMC). The authority warned recently. Speaking in Dar es Salaam following seizure of a truckload of metal waste that included parts of the standard gauge railway (SGR) in Mlandizi, Coast Region, NEMC Director General Samuel Gwamaka said while the government was keen of recycling waste for the good of the nation and encouraged people to collect plastic and metal for recycling, selling waste metal had to be done within the perimeters of law. “The load of metal waste seized in Mlandizi recently is a pointer to the fact that we must remain vigilant because some people are deliberately collecting or vandalising the costly infrastructure like railway lines, bridges and road sign posts and marketing such metal as metal waste. This is a criminal offence. I appeal to all Tanzanians to remain vigilant and protect vital installations,” he said. He said Tanzanians must know that railways, roads and bridges were important prerequisites for modern life and economic growth and they spent substantial amount of money, adding that people must remain observant and report people suspected to be vandalising such infrastructure. It was the duty of all Tanzanians to guard costly rails and road because they were being built for the benefit of the present and future generations, he said. He appealed to Tanzanians to support the efforts of the government in implementing the national agro-industrialisation agenda. People caught in Mlandizi in possession of parts of the SGR, roads and bridges would be taken to court once relevant charges had been framed, he explained.
