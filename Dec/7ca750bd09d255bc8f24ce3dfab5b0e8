SEVEN health officers have found themselves in trouble after indefinitely closed down a health facility due to lack of equipment at Bambi Village in Unguja Central District. Authorities have reacted, saying the move is unacceptable because it has caused inconvenience to people who need services. "Investigation should begin immediately to justify reasons for the closure of the facility...health officers should be suspended to pave the way for investigation," said Central District Commissioner (DC) Hamida Mussa Khamis, adding that the facility had been important for children and expectant mothers in the region. The DC visited the facility and issued a directive not to reopen it, saying it was wrong and against regulations for health workers to close down a health centre without notifying the respective authorities. She said the closure of the clinic sparked off complaints from residents and parents in the area, saying it was prohibited for any staff to close a health facility without the consent of higher authorities in the district, region or employer (ministry). "I was surprised to see civil servants taking such an arbitrary decision, which implied that they were punishing other people," Ms Khamis said. She directed the District Executive Director (DED) to transfer or reallocate the health workers because â€œthey were no longer qualified and interested in serving people." Ms Farhati Mussa Khamis, one of the health workers, admitted to have taken the decision without consulting higher authorities. "We are sorry and apologise for the mess." The health facility is important for the people of Bambi Village, one of the developing villages on Unguja Island. Chief Pharmacist in the Central District Council Khamis Daud Haji said: "The clinic will not be closed because it has been used by many people in the area. There was a shortage of maternal equipment, but it does not justify its closure altogether."
