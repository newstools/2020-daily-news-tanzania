A political crisis in the perennially restive Democratic Republic of Congo has deepened as lawmakers trashed parliament after President Felix Tshisekedi moved to scrap the shaky ruling coalition. Tshisekedi’s government has been in tatters with MPs loyal to his powerful predecessor Joseph Kabila, who command more than 300 seats in the 500-member parliament, increasingly at odds with supporters of the president. Tshisekedi on Sunday said he planned to form a new coalition and warned he might be forced to dissolve parliament and hold fresh elections in a country wracked for decades by conflict and corruption. “The present majority has crumbled and a new majority is required,” he said, adding that if he failed to form a new coalition, fresh elections would be the solution “using the constitutional prerogatives that have been invested in me to come back to you, a sovereign people, and ask for a majority”. The announcement sparked violent scenes in parliament on Monday, with sources close to the assembly’s pro-Kabila speaker charging that lawmakers of Tshisekedi’s party went on the rampage, destroying desks and chairs. Video footage showing individuals overturning desks went viral on social media. An AFP journalist said all the furniture on the podium was wrecked. “The plenary session has been deferred to another date,” parliament said, denouncing the “destruction” of furniture and “the presence of armed bodyguards inside the assembly.” Tshisekedi meanwhile held emergency talks with pro-Kabila Prime Minister Sylvestre Ilunga on Monday afternoon, Ilunga’s office said.
