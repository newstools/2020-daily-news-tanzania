COAST Regional Commissioner (RC) Evarist Ndikilo has directed district commissioners (DCs) to ensure that all 30,197 candidates who passed Standard Seven Examinations in the region this year to start Form 1 when schools open on January 11, 2021. The RC made this statement at the laying of the foundation stone at Chatembo Primary School which was constructed using government funds at 400m/- during his tour of Mkuranga District recently. “I want all DCs in the region to supervise preparations in their areas and ensure all eligible candidates report to their respective schools on time," he said. However, the RC noted that the region was facing a shortage of buildings in government schools caused by an increase in the number of secondary school students each year and students who shifted to the region with their families from other parts of the country. “To address this situation,” he said, “the government has released 16.1bn/- for improving school infrastructure and other 4.6bn/- for school maintenance at five old secondary schools, namely Ruvu, Kibiti, Bagamoyo, Minaki and Kibaha. He also said up to November this year, the region had received 40.1bn/- to fund free education at primary school level. In another development, RC Ndikilo congratulated leaders and education stakeholders in Mkuranga District for working together in addressing challenges facing the education sector in the district.
