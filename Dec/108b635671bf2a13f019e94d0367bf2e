THE Permanent Secretary for the Ministry of Information, Culture, Arts and Sports Hassan Abbasi has assured all Tanzanians that the Serengeti Music Festival will be epic. The festival will take action this Saturday at Uhuru Stadium in Dar es Salaam where more than 50 top artistes will light up the venue. Abbasi made the remarks during a press conference that detailed the preparations for the festival organised by the government with the aim to establish a close relationship between the Arts sector and tourism. Abbasi noted that the festival will also honour the contribution of former artistes who initiated the growth of the country’s music industry. He further noted that the government has put plans to introduce an awarding ceremony next year which will acknowledge artists who have displayed an outstanding record throughout the year. “The government has heard the cries of many artistes about the absence of special awards to honour the artistes. Therefore I declare that we will have the awards in March, 2021.” However, the Permanent Secretary who is also the Chief Government Spokesperson said that the Festival will extend to Sunday, December 27th as a continuation of the Arts and Culture Festival which will be held at TaSuBA in Bagamoyo. On that day there will be various entertainment including traditional dances. Moreover, the Hip Pop artiste, Kala Jeremiah thanked the government for organising the festival, saying he believed that the festival, which has been established during the Christmas period, would continue to be a major festival in the country and in Africa. Likewise, on behalf of the artistes, Khalid Mohamed popularly known as TID thanked the government and assured Tanzanians that they will offer them quality entertainment and asked music fans not to miss it.
