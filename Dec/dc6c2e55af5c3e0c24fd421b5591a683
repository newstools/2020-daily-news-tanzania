THE Chief Justice (CJ) of Tanzania, Prof. Ibrahim Juma has asked advocates in the country to adhere to court code of conducts by observing professionalism and distance themselves from delaying cases unnecessarily. He said some advocates have been deliberately delaying court’s decision, a move that delay justice to innocent people. "Some advocates have been deliberately delaying the court's decision, and thus deny people their rights. This must stop immediately and we must serve people diligently,” he pointed out. The CJ was speaking during the 63rd Admission and Enrollment of new advocates in Dar es Salaam, further saying: “The ethical committee will not hesitate to take disciplinary measures against any advocate who will be found guilty of unprofessional acts. “We are also aware that some advocates have been misinterpreting judgments, and thus mislead the public. The court is also aware that some advocates receive clients’ money and fail to represent them in the court of law despite their agreements… all these must stop.” Elaborating, Prof Juma advised the newly 166 admitted advocates to continue studying in order to update themselves and keep pace with the changing world. On his part, Advocate Onesmo Ole Ngurumwa, said that increasing numbers of lawyers in the public will help the people to know and get their rights, adding that there is a possibility that some will relocate to practice in rural areas.
