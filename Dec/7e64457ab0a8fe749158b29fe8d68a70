Ligue 1 champions Paris Saint-Germain have sacked Thomas Tuchel as the club sit third in Ligue 1. The German boss led the club to the Champions League final last season but they slipped to a narrow defeat at the hands of Bundesliga giants Bayern Munich. The Parisians have had a tricky start to the new league season winning only 11 of their opening 17 matches - leaving them behind both Lyon and Lille. Tuchel was handed the job after failing to topple Bayern with Borussia Dortmund, and went on to win back-to-back league titles as well as two domestic cups. Reports of the news of Tuchel's departure came on Thursday morning, stating that the 47-year-old has left the club the day before Christmas. The news came as a shock to many following their comprehensive 4-0 win over Strasbourg on Wednesday, during which Timothee Pembele, Kylian Mbappe, Idriss Gueye and Moise Kean were all on target.
