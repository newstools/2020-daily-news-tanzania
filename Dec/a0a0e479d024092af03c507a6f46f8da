He added that his expectations in the forthcoming CAF Confederation Cup match is to score more goals to beat their own set record of three goals to nil. “For now, we have an idea on how they play as such, the next match will be totally different and we hope to do even better than the previous duel. In a nutshell, I can say we are a bit safer than them (Al Rabita),” he said. It was the second competitive match for Morocco to be in charge of the Lindi based club and in both occasions, the team has had an impressive performance worth watching.
