SUMBAWANGA Urban Constituency Returning Officer in Rukwa Region, Mr Jacob Mtalitinya has assured the residents that preparations for today’s polls are over by 100 per cent. Mentioning them as ballot papers, forms, stamps and ink bottles being handed over to the polling stations on time, Mr Mtalitinya, who is also the Sumbawanga Municipal Director, told the ‘Daily News’ yesterday that all the agents have been sworn-in. “All necessary training for supervisors and their assistants has been done. Each voting stations should have a security officer, a chief clerk and election agents and all polling stations will be open from 7:00 am to 4:00 am,” he said. However, he called upon the electorates to turn out enmasse to vote for the candidates of their choices. On his part, the Rukwa Regional Religious Leaders Committee Acting Chairman Bishop of Evangelical Lutheran Church of Tanzania (ELCT), Dioceses of Lake Tanganyika, Rev Ambele Mwaipopo, asked his fellow religious leaders to preach peace and avoid political activities, which might deteriorate to inciting violence. “Also parents and guardians should prohibit their children from being used by politicians to secretly vote…others should leave the polling stations after voting and go straight to their homes,” he advised. Meanwhile, the Katavi Regional Police Commander, Mr Benjamin Kuzaga yesterday told the ‘Daily News’ over the phone that police in the area are well prepared to maintain peace and security during the polls. Similar sentiment was made by Rukwa Regional Police Commander, Mr Justine Masejo, who also urged the residents to show up in big numbers and vote.
