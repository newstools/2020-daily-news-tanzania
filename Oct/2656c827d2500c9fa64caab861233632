US President Donald Trump has made a theatrical return to the White House to continue his treatment for coronavirus after a three-night hospital stay. Mr Trump, who is still contagious, removed his mask on the balcony of the White House, while posing for pictures. His physician said he would continue treatment from there, and he "may not entirely be out of the woods yet". Several of Mr Trump's staff and aides have also tested positive for the virus in recent days. Questions remain over the seriousness of Mr Trump's illness after a weekend of conflicting statements. The US has had 7.4 million cases of Covid-19 and 210,000 deaths. Mr Trump's diagnosis has upended his campaign for a second term in office, less than a month before the Republican president faces Democratic challenger Joe Biden in the presidential election.
