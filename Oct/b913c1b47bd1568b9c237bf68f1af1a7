THE leadership of KMC has defended a choice of CCM Kirumba Stadium in Mwanza to stage a Mainland Premier League game against Young Africans on October 25th this year. Previously the match whose hosts are KMC, was scheduled to be played on the same date at Benjamin Mkapa Stadium in Dar es Salaam. The management said the move has been blessed by the Tanzania Premier League Board (TPLB), whose regulation allows a team to pick any venue to host its home matches. The regulations, according to TPLB, allow a team to choose the second home venue and the management saw CCM Kirumba as the ideal venue. Speaking to the ‘Daliy News’ on the matter, the club’s Information and Liaison Officer, Christina Mwagala said: “We know that we have a lot of fans in every region, so we have decided to give the opportunity to people of Mwanza to attend our matches in a big number. We assure them good and highly entertaining game,” she said. However, KMC FC urge fans and supporters of the team in the regions around Mwanza and other areas to show up in large numbers on October 25 this year, to ensure that they come to witness their own team performing well. She added by saying apart from that KMC FC, she also recognizes the value of fans present in various regions of the country. “ We aim to provide entertainment to our fans, who are in every area of Tanzania, hence this time around, we have decided to send such entertainment to our fans in Mwanza Region,” said Mwagala.
