DODOMA City Council has issued 545m/- loans to special groups from its internal sources in the first quarter (Q1) of the fiscal year of 2020/21. Speaking during the issuance of the loans yesterday, Dodoma Regional Commissioner (RC), Dr Binilith Mahenge, said it was in response to the government’s directive to the local government to give 10 per cent of its revenue to special groups as loans. “We are here today to witness the implementation of President Magufuli’s directive to issue loans to special groups of young people, women and people with disabilities for their improved welfare,” he said. He commended the fifth phase government for the initiative, noting that since 2015 loans had been issued without any delay, thus making the beneficiaries’ lives better. Dr Mahenge also commended the amendments to the law as he witnessed the youth being loaned motorcycles they could use as business projects. He said the government’s decision to relocate to Dodoma had created many economic opportunities to the city council as it was among the councils issuing 10 per cent revenue to special groups on time. He appealed to beneficiaries to utilise their loans to improve their livelihoods. Some of the loans issued were in form of motorcycles, auto rickshaws and cheques. Dodoma City Council Executive Director Joseph Mafuru said they had issued more than 1bn/- loans to entrepreneur groups. He explained that from 2015 to 2018/19, 5.2bn/- loans had been issued to 812 women groups, 425 youth groups and 30 persons with disabilities. He noted that as of September this year out of the 5.2bn/- loans issued, 2.5bn/- had been repaid and the city council was making follow-ups to ensure the remaining beneficiaries too, repaired their loans. “In 2020/21, the city council has set aside 2.2bn/- loans for special groups,” he said
