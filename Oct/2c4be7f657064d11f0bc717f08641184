AS part of the efforts to fulfil its social responsibility, DSB Polyclinic and Metropolis Healthcare laboratories have organised a free medical camp in Dar es Salaam. The day-long camp, which will be conducted on Sunday from 8:00am onwards at Sikh Temple in Dar es Salaam, is part of this year’s World Heart Day, which will be celebrated next month. DSB Polyclinic Quality Assurance and Business Development Manager Joyce Kakele said in the city that the camp had also been supported by Shre Guru Singh Sabha. She said the clinic would provide free heart medical services, including blood pressure checks, height, weight and body mass index (BMI), random blood glucose test, free doctor consultation, free electrocardiogram (ECG), echocardiogram (echo) and total cholesterol tests. Electrocardiogram is a medical test that detects cardiac (heart) abnormalities by measuring the electrical activity generated by the heart as it contracts, while echocardiogram is a test that uses ultrasound to show how one’s heart muscle and valves are working. “Cholesterol blood test will be provided free of charge to members of the public,” she insisted. She noted that they saw it necessary and obliged to help communities to ensure happy and healthy lives. “This year’s World Heart Day is unlike any others in many countries. Public health raises concern among many communities given the challenges brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic, especially the physical, emotional and economic toll it has taken,” she said.
