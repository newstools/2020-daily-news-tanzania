AS Coronavirus pandemic still impacts sporting events that have now been banned globally, Athletics Tanzania (AT) has urged all runners not to relax but rather take the chances to prepare well for the forthcoming international assignments. The global effects of Coronavirus saw the postponement and cancellation of several major global sporting events, some of which are  now slightly returning to action despite the fact that other countries are banning spectators in the stadia in the wake of reducing the virus spread. Tullo Chambo, who is the spokesperson of AT said yesterday that despite the running of sporting events in the country after Coronavirus being ruined, the runners are still being affected by the global strict measures that have locked them out of major international assignments. Among other major events was the 2020 shelved Olympic Games which were penciled for  Tokyo, Japan. The games are expected to take place next year,  waiting for the announcement from the International Olympic Committee (IOC). “The postponement of the international sporting events has in some reasons, demoralised our players who were ready for the competitions,” “But in other ways the postponement also has given a room for more local runners to prepare intensively and increase their chances of qualifications,” said Chambo. Among the local runners who qualified for the Tokyo shelved Olympic Games were Alphonce Simbu, who finished fifth at the 2016 Summer Olympics in the men’s marathon with the timing of 2:11:15. The other qualified athlete was Failuna Abdi, who yesterday won the Mount Meru half marathon race. “Our local runners should still stay focused for the international assignments,” They should wait  for our directives as AT is also waiting for the directives from the IOC and other international federations,” he said. Apart from runners, Tanzania was also expected to field other athletes in other sporting events depending on their qualifications.
