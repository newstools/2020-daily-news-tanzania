Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM)'s Union Presidential candidate Dr John Magufuli has re-assured Zanzibar citizens that oil and gas will not be a Union matter. Addressing Wananchi as he is seeking to be re-elected for the second term on Saturday (October 3rd, 2020) at Maisara grounds in Unguja, Dr Magufuli allayed fears on the ownership of the resources as he asked Zanzibaris to prepare themselves to own and control them. Meanwhile, the Union Presidential candidate asked the people of Zanzibar to elect a best leader capable of fighting all sorts of corruption and defend marginalised groups as he named Zanzibar Presidential contestant Dr Hussein Mwinyi as the right candidate.
