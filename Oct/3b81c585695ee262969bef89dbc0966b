CCM Presidential Candidate Dr John Magufuli has unveiled a grand plan for transforming Dar es Salaam city by improving its infrastructure and business environment to ensure productivity and economic growth. Dr Magufuli said if elected in the October 28 polls, his government will focus on improving infrastructure in the city to facilitate businesses and influence investment in the region and the country at large. The incumbent President Magufuli was addressing thousands of voters during his first campaign rally in Dar es Salaam. The historic campaign rally was held at the Benjamin Mkapa Stadium in Temeke municipality. According to Dr Magufuli, Dar es Salaam has a population of 6million people, and it is expected to grow to 10 million by 2030 and that there is need for the government to set up strong infrastructure that will enable business activities to take place in the city. He said if re-elected in the coming general election, his government will get an opportunity to implement various development projects that are highlighted in the party’s manifesto. He said the government is looking forward to constructing a number of flyovers in the city to ease traffic and facilitate business activities. According to studies conducted in 2010, the government was losing a total of 4bn/- every day due to traffic jam. He said plans are already in place for the construction of flyovers at the junctions of Morocco, Mwenge, Tabata, Fire area (Magomeni), and Uhasibu in Temeke District. He added that the government will also finalise the construction of Tanzanite Bridge on Mzinga River.

Moreover, Dr Magufuli promised to give special priority to new Dar es Salaam’s districts of Ubungo and Kigamboni, saying the two areas need special focus on infrastructure. “I am aware of the challenges facing the new districts, we are going to construct tarmac roads and other infrastructure in these two districts, we are going to change this city,” he noted. He added that Ilala District also needs special attention. He said the area needs improved infrastructures to ensure better social services and boost economic activities.
