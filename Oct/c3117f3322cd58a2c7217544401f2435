PRESIDENT John Magufuli has toured the newly constructed mosque in Dar es Salaam, under the financing of King of Morocco, Mohammed VI, expressing his gratitude for completion of the project. The state-of-the-art mosque which is owned by the National Muslim Council of Tanzania (Bakwata) is built at Kinondoni District in the City. At the project site, President Magufuli was received by Chief Sheikh Mufti Aboubakary Zubeiry, Moroccan ambassador to Tanzania, Mr Abdelilah Benryane and other leaders from the National Muslim Council of Tanzania (Bakwata). The construction of the mosque started in 2018 after President Magufuli held talks with the Moroccan leader when the latter paid a state visit in Tanzania, during which Dr Magufuli asked the King of Morocco to support the construction of the place of worship for Muslims in Tanzania. Having toured the project, President Magufuli expressed his satisfaction with the quality of the construction work undertaken. Dr Magufuli promised to write the King of Morocco, Mohammed VI an invitation letter so that he may fly again to Tanzania to inaugurate the mosque. He asked the Moroccan ambassador to Tanzania, Mr Benryane to convey his sincere appreciations to the King of Morocco for the project. Mufti Chief Sheikh Abubakar Zuberi Ally led a special prayer for the nation and Dr Magufuli, thanking God for facilitating the implementation of the mosque project.
