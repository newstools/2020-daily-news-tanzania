The bank said in its e-Market report that it remained steady backed by supply observed from agri-commodities, particularly cashew nuts. “Demand from corporates such as oil marketing companies (OMCs), manufactures and telecoms continue to match the current supply. “We expect the local currency to remain stable,” NMB’s e-market report said.
