LOCATED in the southern circuit, Kitulo national park is very unique in the world because of its flora and fauna which is dominated by flowers, on the other side scientists say flowers are reproductive structures found in flowering plants, these are modified colourful leaves which use special odor and sugary liquid to attract birds and insects for pollination. Scientists estimate that the planet Earth is covered by more than 315,000 species of plant which silently hold an upper hand above other terrestrial creatures of the world, powered by photosynthesis process these are gorgeous creatures which were described by one greater philosopher who said “notice how the flowers grow, they don’t toil or spin but I tell you not even Solomon (Suleiman) in all his splendors was not dressed like one of them.” Flowers make about 90% of all living plant species, this mean that without these beautiful plants happiness would be a mystery thing in the world because of their contribution for availability of food on our tables and wild fruits for primates and grasses for herbivorous communities in the tropical savannah. Plants are the main supplier of food for insects, birds and animals while trees, bushes and grasses form a very big air filter which take out carbon dioxide to create conducive environment for other creatures to thrive on the planet Earth from about 450 million years ago when the first land plant evolved and thrived following advancement of the ancient photosynthesis process. As you are reading this article you will find that we are not against what you believe from the sacred process behind creation, what we are doing here is to uncover some of big enigmatic stapes which took place millions of years ago, paleontologists say the Earth was formed about 4.5 billion years ago when the universe expanded due to what scientists say very high density and high temperature which resulted from the initial expansion that took place about 13.8 billion years ago when the universe came into being. On another hand different geological evidences indicate the first life evolved on the earth’s surface about 4.1 billion years ago and historians believe that a primitive process of photosynthesis came into existence after the evolution of oxygen into the Earth about 3.5 billion years ago, scientists say that was important step in a complex process of evolution because the chemical element appeared earlier about 3.7 billion years ago when the atmosphere was composed of volcanic and greenhouse gases. The evolution of plants which used ancient photosynthesis become a catalyst for existence of life on planet because the process began to enrich the atmosphere with good amount of oxygen about 2.4 billion years ago when the world was still dominated with microscopic organisms. Different researches indicate that about 1.5 billion years ago the Earth passed through a long ice age which wiped out most of ancient plants that existed in the prehistoric world but scientists say different kind of earliest organisms continued to thrive. To other creatures the event was a catastrophe because the Earth became under domination of heavy ice sheets each lasting for 10 million years between 750 and 590 million years ago when the average temperatures were about −50 °C or −58 °F which made life impossible on the third planet from the Sun but is estimated that about 580 million years ago the availability of enough oxygen contributed again into the evolution of complex multicellular organism a group which was mainly made by bacteria, this shows that right from the beginning of the time photosynthesis played a very important role into the existence of life in different ecosystem of the world. Meanwhile paleontologists say between 555 and 539 million years ago ancestors of all arthropods started to evolve on the Earth’s surface, these were ancient creatures who about 530 million years ago started to undergo different changes which enabled them to thrive under sea bed until 525 million years ago when some of them such as the giant dragonfly which used its 55 to 70 centimeters wingspan to migrate and dominate the ancient world. Scientists say the history of evolution of plants on the Earth is very complicated but it is estimated that the earliest plant appeared about 1.2 billion years ago, this was an algal scum which dominated the planet until about 450 million years ago when the first land plant evolved and thrived following advancement of the ancient photosynthesis process. To survive in an ancient world which was experiencing low oxygen with big amount of carbon dioxide from volcanic activities, about 360 million years ago plants developed stomata and adapted xylem and phloem vascular tissues which enabled them to spread into different ecosystems including arid and semi-arid lands where the savannah is available today. It was during that period about 360 million years ago when ancestors of modern green plants got leaves, that was an important stage of evolution of plants because the presence of vascular conducting system helped them to use their environment effectively by obtaining carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and leaf which draw water from the ground. Unlike other creatures such as lions, primates and wildebeests which leave by eating food materials from others, from about 360 million years ago, plants survive by capturing light energy from the sky and drawing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere which was used with water during photosynthesis to produce their own food which is sugar consisting of glucose and sucrose. Paleontologists say from about 360 million years ago seed plant spread into different ecosystem and become source of food for different olden animals, birds and insects, meanwhile the second generation of seed plants appeared about 340 million years ago and triggered the flourishing of the ancient forests in different parts of the world, the existence of both flowering and seed plants enabled a smooth evolution of arthropods about 319 million years ago. Scientists say ancient plants got further development when they adapted ability to multiply through pollination a process which started about 358.9 million years ago when average global temperatures rose to 20 °C or 68 °F, this kind of climate favored the expansion of ancient forests, the presence of forests in different ecosystems around the world which produced dry plant materials such as roots, foliage, barks, buds and woods which contributed into evolution of the first generation of termites that enjoyed an abundant supply of food. With the world going through more changes, one of the first generations of plants evolved into one of ancient ecosystem about 385 million years ago, scientists say these were plants very tall with wide leaves which enabled the ancient photosynthesis to work efficiently and contributed some of them to have a unique capacity for living for several thousand years but few had capacities of extending their life span for more than 370 million years. Some ancient plant clades such as Gymnosperms and Angiosperms a group which consists many species including cucumbers evolved about 319 million years ago and played key role in the evolution of flowerlike plant about 150 million years. Fossils records show that ancestors of flies and beetles were the first agents of the ancient pollination process but about 145 million years ago prehistoric generation of bees contributed massively in this process as they collected nectars from one plant to another while playing a key role in distribution of pollens and enabled expansion of flowering plants into different ecosystems. Paleontologists say it was during that period when climate restricted ice sheets on high lands and mountain and opened the rest of the world to more flowering plants to thrive in the world which supported evolution of wasp and termites into the growing forests and savannah of the ancient world, scientists say the Savannah is the latest ecosystem to emerge in Africa and other parts of the World as a result of a huge climate changes accompanied with a rise of temperature and decrease of rainfalls. On their side historians believe that these climatic and ecological changes took place on the Earth’s surface about 100 million years ago, fossil records dated this time indicate that the Earth came under Asteroids attacks from the Solar system which influenced geological and metrological changes on the ground and sky. Scientists say at that time the world was very cold and dry but due to these attacks the climate the planet became warm and humid, worldwide different changes took place with subtropical vegetation growing in the northern hemisphere, the Earth’s poles became cool and temperate. The Equatorial areas of the world adapted tropical climate while the southern and northern parts of Equator became hot and arid, these were rapid changes which became a havoc that forced many living creatures into mass extinction after killing all members of that particular species of plant and animals. Today Kitulo National Park attract tourists from different parts of the world because of beautiful flowers which enabled some tourist to call it The garden of God while botanists say the park is Serengeti of Flowers. rstanslaus@yahoo.com
