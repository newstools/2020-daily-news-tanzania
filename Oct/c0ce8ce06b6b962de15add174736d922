POLICE Force in Shinyanga Region is holding four people for allegedly setting fire to the house of Member of Parliament (MP)-elect CCM for Shinyanga Urban Constituency Patrobas Katambi. The suspects were found in a Toyota Kluger car (T729 DFP), the property of then Chadema Parliamentary Candidate Salome Makamba. Shinyanga Regional Police Commander Debora Magiligimba confirmed the incident, saying it took place on Thursday midnight. She said the MP-elect and other family members were alarmed by footsteps on the roof of the outdoor toilet before they got out only to witness fire that was just starting to blaze. “They also found a petrol jerry can around and started extinguishing the fire. As they continued with the task they saw a Toyota Kugger car, with two men running towards it, got onboard before they drove off,” said the RPC. Some family members ran after the vehicle driven along Shinyanga-Mwanza Road before the suspects entered Shinyanga Regional Hospital’s compound and parked it. Mr Katambi’s family members identified the suspects by recalling how they were dressed. They informed the police, whose officers conducted inspection and arrested the suspects. After interrogation, they agreed the car’s owner was the one who was contesting through Chadema. “The driver, Mr Timoth Makamba, who is the younger brother of the then Chadema candidate, escaped by jumping over the wall.' According to the RPC, police are still hunting for Ms Makamba (the then Chadema candidate) and her young brother, the vehicle driver, who had escaped. The RPC named the suspects as Wilson Saluti and Jackson Peter who were caught in the vehicle as well as Justine Owesiga and Gibson Mkongwa, who were held after the police inspected the Chadema candidate’s home.
