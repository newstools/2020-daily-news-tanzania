ACT- Wazalendo party’s Presidential candidate for Zanzibar, Maalim Seif Sharif Hamad has promised civil servants that they should not fear retrenchment, because his government plans to ensure increased salary and allowances. Speaking at a campaign rally at Ditia play ground, Wawi, Chakechake District in South Pemba, Mr Maalim Seif said the current gaps in their welfare will be solved during his tenure if they vote him into power. He further promised that all pending arrears, including teachers leave allowances will be paid, asking the civil servants to work harder in the next government. At the public rally, Maalim Seif also asked residents there to vote for MPs, House of Representatives, and councillors from his party so as to have a working team in his new government. Meanwhile, the ACT-Wazalendo presidential candidate reiterated his call to the police to act fairly when dealing with incidents of breach of laws in the country, particularly those linked to politics. Mr Maalim Seif, who is vying for Zanzibar presidency for the sixth time since 1995, claimed that chances for him emerging the winner were high as he had come up with acceptable party election manifesto containing good plans for Zanzibar’s prosperity.
