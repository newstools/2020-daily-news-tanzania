TO see into it that every Tanzanian gets medical attention in any hospital through health scheme, the National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF), recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the NMB bank to facilitate the nationals’ contributions and implementation of the arrangement. Before signing the agreement recently, the NHIF Director General, Bernard Konga said the scheme will enable the contributor to put money, whatever little and bit by bit through the bank to reach what is targeted and get medical attention as a member of the Fund. Marketing the scheme as DUNDULIZA he noted that it will take care of all classes of people, be they elders, children, hawkers, farmers as well as bodaboda riders among others. Equally to join the NHIF membership, one can download the NHIF Tanzania forms, provided as Membership, Student, Toto Afya Kadi, Employer, Mutual and Private individual registration form, filled and then presented to any NHIF office for approval. On her part, NMB bank Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Ruth Zaipuna said the arrangement was made to support the government in drawing health services closer to the citizens, saying: “NMB being the people’s bank, it was necessary to partner in such a way that the community is taken into consideration as we have been doing in our plough backs.” She said the practice of contributing money bit by bit will also enhance the culture of people saving money for future use, adding: “Health is a concern and even with us as a bank, we want customers who are assured of getting medical attention every time not waiting to get their money saved to pay as medical bills.”
