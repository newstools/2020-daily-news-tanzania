MINISTER for Natural Resources and Tourism, Dr Khamis Kigwangalla, has urged the management of Pasiansi Wildlife Training Institute (PWTI) to establish a bush meat butcher’s. Dr Kigwangalla said the butcheries would enable more people in the Lake Zone to benefit from wildlife resources. The minister gave directives on Wednesday after launching a new PWTI Board of Directors led by Board Chairman, Prof Hassan Shombe, at a function also attended by the college staff. He said President John Magufuli had directed his ministry this year to establish bush meat butchers in the country and it was the right time for the institute management to implement the directive. “It is high time for PWTI to establish a bush meat butchery as it has big number of experts who are knowledgeable about wildlife management and conservation. “You can establish wildlife meat business and help Tanzanians in Lake Zone to benefit from their resources,” he explained. In the fight against poaching, Dr Kigwangalla said the government had done a big job, leading to a decrease of up to 80 per cent. Responding to various issues raised by the PWTI management such as lack of equipment, a shortage of staff and deteriorating infrastructure, he said the government was working on the issues and soon things would change for better. He congratulated the newly picked PWTI board of directors and urged them to work tirelessly and support PWTI by finding solutions to problems facing them. “PWTI is privileged to get outstanding board members. I hope they are going to deliver for the betterment of PWTI and the country at large,” he added. For his part, Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Natural Resources and Tourism, Dr Aloyce Nzuki, congratulated new board members and urged the management and staff to support the team and enable them to deliver to achieve sustainable development. Expressing gratitude on behalf of his board members, Prof Shombe promised to work hard and bring about positive results.
