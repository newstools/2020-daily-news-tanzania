TAIFA Stars Head Coach, Etienne Ndayiragije has said his squad is in a good shape to overpower Burundi at Benjamin Mkapa Stadium on Sunday despite missing the services of lethal striker, John Bocco. Taifa Stars will play Burundi, nicknamed ‘Swallows’ in FIFA-date international friendly after the six-month hiatus due to coronavirus scare. “I have all the players at their fitness except John Bocco who is still nursing injuries,” “I pray to God for his quick recovery,” said Ndayiragije. “He is one of the most important players in the team considering the fact that he is also the captain for the home-based national team players,” said Ndayigarije. However, he said that all the players are important at their different positions and there are those who can cover their places effectively. He said that Taifa Stars do not under-rate their opponents since they are a better side to give Stars a stiff challenge. “Their football style is like what Tunisia play, the reason why we opted to play them as our build up for our AFCON qualifying match against Tunisia,’ he said. The match will be a build up for Taifa Stars ahead of their 2021 Afcon qualifier against Tunisia to be played in November in Tunis and return leg tie to be played in Dar es Salaam in a fortnight. Meanwhile, the Burundian revealed he is already satisfied with the preparation of the players, expecting to yield good results. “Tanzanians should pray for us as we are going to represent them,” “We are in a good course to deliver though anything can happen in football,” he said. Among those in the team are Taifa Stars captain and a former Aston Villa striker, Mbwana Samatta who currently plays for Turkish side, Fenerbahce. Others who got calls are Simon Msuva who plays in Morocco, Thomas Ulimwengu who trades skills in Congo DRC and Himid Mao, who according to coach, was expected to arrive anytime from Egypt where he serves ENNPI FC
