A LONG seasoned national team wicket keeper, Issa Kikasi has said that Tanzania under Kenyan coach, Steve Tikolo will have a good representation in the next year's ICC major tournaments. Kikasi, who is now gearing up for the forthcoming TCA Caravan Cup slated for this weekend at the Dar es Salaam Leaders Club said that Tikolo, who represented Kenyan five times in ICC World Cups, has sharpened senior teams to the best of competition levels. "We see our pace coming back after several years' of misfortunes," said Kikasi. "The recently ended Advanced Players League (APL) was a clear indication of players' improvement and they are eager to play to the highest level of their ability. "We know the prowess of Tikolo in coaching and is a well experienced former Kenyan national team players whose ambition is to take us to the next level," he said. " Our hope of retaining the highest levels of competition is now restored, what is needed is for the players and management to continue working together and put our flag high," he said. Tikolo took reign of the team early this year and one of the major tests he had was taking the senior men and Under-19 Women teams to the ICC-Africa tournaments but the events were shaved off because of the prevailed Coronavirus eruption. Before the tournaments cancelation, he took the men's team to the top performance during their trials in Zimbabwe. After the deadly Coronavirus eruption, many of the ICC tournaments in Africa have been pushed back to next year. Among others, including the ICC-Africa T20 tournament that is likely to be held in South Africa in April next year. The coming of Tikolo to take charge on senior and junior national teams took back to the field several other former national teams players including Athumani Kakonzi.
