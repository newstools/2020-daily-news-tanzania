PRESIDENT John Magufuli has promised fortune to sports and arts sector while also promising to support the National football team, Taifa Stars and make it perform well to end the ugly madman head tag when handed the second five-year presidency. President Magufuli made that promise at the Benjamin Mkapa stadium on Friday during his first day of the election campaign in Dar es Salaam after seeing Tanzanian teams being always the losing sides when competing against other nations in the regional or continental tournaments. The former President Ali Hassan Mwinyi compared Tanzanian teams with the madman head that anybody can use to learn shaving after the country completely failed to shine in most of events it participated. He said he will start contributing funds to the national level teams heading to represent Tanzania in the international tournaments. “We are fed up being compared with the madman head which anyone can use to learn how to shave,” he said. In retrospect JPM also said the move to construct an hyper class sports arena in Dodoma is going on according to the plans which will go alongside the rehabilitation of the existing ones. On arts and entertainment, JPM said he will make sure there is special fund that will boost arts and artistes countrywide. Altogether, JPM said through the funding, artists and artistes will benefit from education and loans as well as to enable the effective use of copyrights to enable artistes benefit from their artistic works. He said arts and entertainment sector has contributed much to the country’s revenue as most of them have become world figures at the moment. JPM lauded the artistes for maturity in entertainment compared to the past when band musicians were not adept enough in that discipline.
