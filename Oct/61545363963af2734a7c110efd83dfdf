THE Minister for Industry and Trade, Mr Innocent Bashungwa has lifted the ban on exportation of ethanol, following an increase in production of the raw material for making sanitizers and disinfectants. The Ministry' statement that was issued by the Permanent Secretary, Prof Riziki Shemdoe said that the available ethanol in the country surpasses local demand, therefore the option is to export the surplus. "However, the minister is urging all ethanol producers and exporters to continue adhering to legal procedures in their business," said Prof Shemdoe. In March this year, the government banned ethanol export as the country battled to contain the spread of covid-19. The ban aimed at strengthening the availability of the raw material to enable local industries produce enough sanitizers to cope with the high local demand of the products. Only three industries manufactured the Covid-19 preventive gears and chemicals in the country, but still their production seemed to be down due to inadequate raw materials. The manufacturers included Keko Pharmaceutical Limited, Mansoor Days Chemicals Limited as well as Tarmal Industries Limited, which had between 1,500 and 5,000 litres capacity a day. It was further noted that the Tanzania Industrial Research and Development Organization (Tirdo) produced a maximum of 360 litres of ethanol a week, an amount that didn't meet the demand.
