A teacher has been beheaded in broad day light on the streets after showing pupils cartoons of Prophet Muhammad. Samuel Paty was beheaded outside the school at the streets of Paris in France. The 47-year-old had received threats after opening a discussion 'for a debate' about the caricatures about 10 days ago before he was stabbed and decapitated by 18-year-old Chechen gunman Aboulakh A in Conflans-Sainte-Honorine 25 miles north-west of Paris. Reports say the old history teacher was trying to express the freedom of expression to pupils in a civic class which rouse anger to a number of Muslim parents. Police shot dead the attacker. The French police sources say they have arrested nine people after a suspect beheaded a school teacher in broad daylight on the street in a Paris suburb on Friday. Muslims believe that any depiction of the prophet is blasphemous. The killing was described by French President Emmanuel Macron on Friday as a “terrorist attack”.
