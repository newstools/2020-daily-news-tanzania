CCM parliamentary candidate for Tarime Rural constituency, Mr Mwita Waitara has promised to create a good relationship between local communities living near the northern fringes of Serengeti National Park (SENAPA) and conservationists, including game rangers. Mr Waitara gave the promise during his latest campaign rally he conducted at Kegonga village located close to SENAPA. “Elect me and other CCM candidates (president and councillors). After elections we will sit with district leaders and SENAPA officials to find lasting solutions on your problems,” said Mr Waitara, who is also the Deputy Minister of State in the President’s Office (Regional Administration and Local Government) during his campaign rally in the remote village which also borders neighbouring Kenya. He said frequent seizure of cows found grazing in the park is one of the issues which will be addressed without compromising ongoing conservation efforts. He also promised that Kegonga and other neighbouring villages will be connected with electricity as soon as possible. Mr Waitara also promised loans to empower youth ad women groups in the villages among other things. “We are well prepared to serve you (citizens) better, I ask you not to make a mistake. Elect me to be your member of parliament and my colleagues for presidential and councillor posts. We are prepared to serve you,” Mr Waitara repeatedly insisted. Mr Waitara is competing against Mr John Heche of CHADEMA and Charles Mwera of ACT- Wazalendo. Tanzania will hold general elections October 28.
