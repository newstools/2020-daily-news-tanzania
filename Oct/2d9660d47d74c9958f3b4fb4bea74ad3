THE government has released national biofortification guidelines that will address nutrient deficiencies among the population. The guidelines, disseminated by the Ministry of Agriculture in collaboration with Nutrition International, provide stakeholders with guidance on managing their crop value chain activities. “These guidelines will help stakeholders in food chain sector to produce nutritious foods that will improve nutrition in the community and enable us to achieve our target of ending malnutrition that’s caused by lack of minerals and vitamins,” said Acting Shinyanga Regional Administrative Secretary, Mr Beda Chamatata while speaking at a nutrition stakeholder’s dissemination meeting in Shinyanga. He also called on stakeholders to support the dissemination of the guidelines through their plans and budgets. In Tanzania, 58 per cent of children aged 6-59 months and 45 per cent of women are anaemic, according to the Demographic, Health and Malaria Indicator Survey (2015/16). The guidelines will bridge the agriculture and health sectors, and strengthen biofortification interventions that will help reduce micronutrient deficiencies in the country. The ministry led the development of the guidelines with financial support and technical assistance from Nutrition International as part of the Enhancing Nutrition Services to Improve Maternal and Child Health (ENRICH) Project, funded by the Government of Canada. ENRICH is led by World Vision, with support from consortium partners Nutrition International, Canadian Society for International Health, HarvestPlus and the University of Toronto. Project-level disseminations will be held in Shinyanga and Singida (two regions where the ENRICH project is being implemented) on September 30 and October 2, respectively. More dissemination will take place throughout the year, including on World Food Day in October.
