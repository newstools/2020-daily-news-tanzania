President John Magufuli has ordered a contractor of the Mbezi Luis International Bus Terminal project to accomplish the task by November, 2020. Speaking before laying a foundation stone for the multi-billion project at Mbezi Mwisho in Dar es Salaam early on Thursday, President Magufuli said the project was supposed to be completed July, this year but the contactor has failed to fulfill the promise. The Head of State insisted that his government will no longer accept excuse from the contractor. At the event attended by Malawi President Dr Lazarus Chakwera, who is in Tanzania for a three-day state visit, Dr Magufuli said since the facility will accommodate buses from upcountry and neighbouring countries, Immigration Department should open its office at the areas to serve people. Meanwhile, President Chakwera praised Tanzania for implementing various mega projects using its own fund.
