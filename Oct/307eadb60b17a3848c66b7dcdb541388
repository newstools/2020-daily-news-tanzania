KINONDONI constituency candidate on ACT- Wazalendo ticket, Mr Saed Kubenea has outlined his priorities, the top being to set up a bank for the people of the constituency, if elected on October 28th, this year. He made the commitment while addressing Mwananyamala and Magomeni residents during his campaign rally Sunday. “We want to improve the lives of our fellow Tanzanians in Kinondoni municipality, especially small scale traders and motorcycle riders (bodaboda) by establishing a Kinondoni Community Bank that will function, as it is the case with Dar es Salaam Community Bank (DCB),” said Kubenea. Besides, he said, the bank will provide loans to the traders where it will enable them to develop their businesses. Mr Kubenea further said for many years, he has worked as an advocate through the media, as an MP for Ubungo constituency and serving in various nongovernmental organizations, so he asked for voters in the area to give him another chance to return to parliament to reinforce the work that he already began. “If elected to represent Kinondoni constituency, I promise to raise all issues that matter to you, I have never failed at work,” he pledged. Another area that he pledged to work on include ensuring that everyone who has reached the age of 60 receives free medical treatment as well as ensuring that every Tanzanian has health insurance. He also vowed to work on the Msimbazi River channel and transform it from a liability into an opportunity by turning it to a tourist attraction. Mr Kubenea said, once elected to represent Kinondoni he will ensure the issue of waste is eliminated by building a factory to produce manure from solid waste. He said, they planned to build the factory in 2015-2020 but when the constituency was divided to form Ubungo and Kinondoni constituencies, the plan which was to be implemented by development partner’s was shelved. Kubenea said, as an MP, he will develop the as it will also provide jobs and keep the city clean.
