THE Kagera Region Inter Agency Legal Aid Coordination Committee Chairman, Nestory Nchimani has called upon District Councils in the region to compile a list of paralegals and assist them to get registration. “Paralegals are key instruments in fostering the nation’s development. Efforts should be made to support them, because they reach most people at the grassroots level who cannot afford to hire advocates,” he said. Equally, he appealed to the media to work closely with paralegals while also exposing norms that keep women and children in the backyard. Marginalized groups include women, children, the elderly and people living with impairment. The media can play a crucial role by exposing gender imbalances that face them, he said. He made the appeal recently during the second meeting of the committee after it was launched on July 10th, this year by the Deputy Permanent Secretary in the Ministry for Constitution and Legal Affairs, Mr Amon Mpanju. It was revealed during the meeting that about 15 organizations were providing legal aid services in the region but only three were registered. Kagera Regional Administrative Secretary (RAS), Professor Faustin Kamuzora explained that the region had a population of about 3.1 million people who are in dire need of paralegal aid.
