WOMEN electorate in Zanzibar have been implored to make better and informed decisions when electing their leaders in the forthcoming polls. “We need leaders who will consider our problems and help find solutions,” Activist Ms Siti Abbasi Ali- Chairwoman of the 'Savings and Loan Entrepreneurs Groups' said in a meeting with entrepreneurs from Mwera and Mtoni villages, Unguja. She said it was important for women to assess candidates in terms of commitment and listen carefully to women candidates, so that they elect those who would steadfastly push women and children affairs after the elections. “We also need to ensure women candidates are elected to achieve gender equality. Also with increased access to and participation of women in decision making spaces, we can develop strategies for the betterment of our standards of living,” Ms Ali said. The activist also reminded members of the entrepreneurs that most of their challenges may be solved by making the right decision through the ballot box. The 2020 General Election will be held on October 28th, this year. Ms Amina Hassan, one of the entrepreneurs, said it was important for the next president to address the serious challenges facing women in the country, including unemployment and violation of their rights. “We need a meaningful economic empowerment...physical and sexual abuse must also be stopped,” Ms Hassan said as she joined her colleagues to thank the outgoing President, Ali Mohamed Shein for his good work in attending women issues.
