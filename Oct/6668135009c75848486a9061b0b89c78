A VILLAGE in Babati has received a school bus, to help it address truancy and early marriage challenges. Chemchem Safaris has donated a 200m/- bus to Ngaiti Secondary School in Vilima Vitatu Village, Manyara Region, as the school continues grappling with truancy and early marriage among girl students. Handing over the bus to the village, Babati District Commissioner, Lazaro Twange expressed gratitude to Chemchem Safaris, saying the donation would help improve education at the school. “This school bus will save students from walking long distances to and from school,” he said. According to the DC, students used to travel seven kilometres every day to and from school. For her part, District Education Officer Paulina Mpare said early marriage was still a big problem in the area. “On their way to and from school, some of the girl students are seduced by men and end up involving themselves in love affairs, being pregnant and dropping out of school,” she explained. Globally, between now and 2030, child marriage is expected to cost the equivalent of trillions of dollars to populations in the developing world. In Tanzania, 31 per cent of girls are married before their 18th birthday and 5 per cent are married by the age of 15. A 2017 study by Forward shows that poverty is considered the leading driver of child marriage in the country.
