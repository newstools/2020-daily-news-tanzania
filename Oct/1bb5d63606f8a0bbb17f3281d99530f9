THE UDP parliamentary candidate for Sumbawanga Urban Constituency, Mr Michael Lubava, in Rukwa Region has said his election campaigns will delay as a result of financial constraints. He said his launch will instead be on October 15th, this year as instructed by party Chairman, Mr John Cheyo, adding: “Due to financial constraints facing the party at the moment, Chairman Cheyo has instructed me to officially launch my election campaigns on October 15th, this year that means 13 days to the General Election day.” Elaborating, Mr Lubuva yesterday told the ‘Daily News’ over phone that the delay will not affect his election campaigns, because voting day is still ahead on October 28th, 2020, adding: “I'm sure, I will manage to cover all the 19 wards in the constituency.” However, he noted that UDP has only one candidate for councilorship contesting at Mafulala Ward that they are sure to capture. Reached for a comment on the situation on the ground, the Sumbawanga Urban Constituency Returning Officer, Mr Jacob Mtalitinya confirmed that five out of six parties have launched their election campaigns except UDP. He further said that there are 63 candidates, who are contesting for councilorship in 19 wards, but at Musia Ward there is only one, who is fielding CCM flag after Chadema aspirant pulled out of the race.
