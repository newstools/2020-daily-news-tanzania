US President Donald Trump says he is doing well, but that the next few days will be the "real test". The video, posted on Twitter on Saturday evening, comes after mixed messages earlier in the day about his health, after a Covid-19 diagnosis. The president's physician said late on Saturday that Mr Trump was doing well and had made "substantial progress since diagnosis". Mr Trump is spending his second night in hospital. Dr Sean Conley said in a statement that "while not yet out of the woods, the team remains cautiously optimistic" about the president's condition. A few hours earlier, in the four-minute video message, Mr Trump, dressed in a suit jacket and shirt with no tie, thanked the doctors and nurses at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center close to Washington DC, where he is being treated. "I came here, wasn't feeling so well, I'm much better now," he said, later adding: "Over the next period of a few days I guess that's the real test. We'll be seeing what happens over those next couple of days." He said he wanted to get back on the campaign trail. Mr Trump faces Joe Biden in the 3 November presidential election. The positive Covid-19 diagnosis, made public by the president in a tweet early on Friday, has upended his campaign and also cast doubt on his attempt to get a new Supreme Court judge confirmed before polling day.
