SON of the Tanzanian’s first president, the late Mwalimu Julius Nyerere, Madaraka Nyerere has reminded the public to continue maintaining peace and unity the founding father of the nation longed for. As the nation commemorate 21st anniversary death of the founding father of the nation, today and head into the General Election on October 28th, this year, Madaraka Nyerere said it was important for Tanzania to remain solid before, during and after the election as it has always been before. The sixth son of Mwalimu Nyerere made the appeal during an exclusive interview with the ‘Daily News’ early this week, saying Tanzania has maintained its place as a peacefully nation in Africa and a safe-haven for refugees from various war ravaged countries. However, he cautioned against any acts of disrupting the prevailing peace and tranquility, which enables the nation to continue attaining its development goals in various sectors. “My big message to Tanzanians is that we continue to maintain peace and our unity,” Mr Madaraka said, adding that by so doing, he said, Tanzania will be honouring Mwalimu Nyerere in a proper way. He also reminded Tanzanians to continue embracing wildlife conservation ideas initiated by Mwalimu Nyerere. Mr Madaraka also commended all conservation stakeholders working hard to protect and conserve the great Serengeti ecosystem and other conserved areas across the country. The stakeholders included local communities, Tanzania National Parks Authority (TANAPA) , Frankfurt Zoological Society(FZS) and Grumeti Reserves through Grumeti Fund among others. “The stakeholders are indeed doing a great job for sustainable development of wildlife and tourism sectors. They deserve to be congratulated,” said the son of Mwalimu Nyerere. Madaraka is leading Global Resources Alliance -Tanzania, an organisation that priorities environmental conservation matters like supporting trees planting programmes in the region among other things.
