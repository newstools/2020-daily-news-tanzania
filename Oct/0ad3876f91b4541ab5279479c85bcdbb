AS the country joined the rest of the world to mark the third World Statistics Day, Government’s Chief Statistician, Dr Albina Chuwa has reminded Tanzanians to make use of appropriate data provided by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). The World Statistics Day was observed globally yesterday with a theme “Connecting the world with data we can trust.” According to Dr Chuwa, the theme reflected on the importance of trust, authoritative data, innovation and the public good in national statistical systems. The celebration of World Statistics Day 2020 is a global collaborative endeavour, organised under the guidance of the United Nations Statistical Commission. Addressing a news conference here, the Chief Statistician asked all stakeholders to use available data provided by NBS to plan for the country’s development. “We should put up plans that will complement with the UN Secretary General’s ambition that better data better lives. At its 41st Session in February 2010, the United Nations Statistical Commission proposed celebrating 20 October 2010 as World Statistics Day (Decision 41/109) In 2015, with resolution 96/282, the General Assembly decided to designate 20 October 2015 as the second World Statistics Day under the general theme “Better data, better lives,” as well as to celebrate World Statistics Day every five years on 20 October. So far, according to Dr Chuwa, since the passing of the resolution in 2015, Tanzania has made tremendous strides in strengthening data system in the country. Through Tanzania Statistical Master Plan Phase 1, NBS had intensified capacity building programmes to all statisticians in the ministry and other government institutions, as well as conducting various researches by using the best technology instead of using papers.
