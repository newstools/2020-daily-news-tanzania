KMC’s Head Coach Habibu Kondo has assured the team’s fans and management of good results in the remaining matches after a two-match hiccup as he believes in his players’ qualities and abilities. KMC, who started the season strongly with three consecutive wins, suffered a slim 1-0 loss in their two recent matches. Coach Kondo said in reaction to a 1-0 loss to Polisi Tanzania in the Premier League match staged at the Uhuru stadium in Dar es Salaam. Kondo said; “I believe in the skills and abilities of my players and I hope things will turn around just on time. “We are preparing ourselves for the coming matches and we are working hard technically to improve on the weak areas that cost us points in the two previous games.” He added that the team creates a lot of good chances but poor finishing has let them down in their last two matches. He said he is now re-organising the striking force that will enable the team to improve marksmanship. He said they are now gearing up for their next match against Coastal Union after the climax of International break. He said KMC have produced two players in the Taifa Stars squad that will face Burundi in the FIFA date international friendly this weekend at Benjamin Mkapa stadium in Dar es Salaam. “This short break of the league will give us enough time to work effectively in some areas of weakness, especially those which helped our opponents to beat us,” he explained. KMC are now placed seventh in the league standing after posting 9 points.
