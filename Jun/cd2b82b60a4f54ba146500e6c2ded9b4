THE government general budget that was tabled last week in Dodoma has been hailed by activists and members of the public as keenly framed to cover ordinary people. Haki Sawa kwa Maisha Bora, an institution that focuses on development programmes, environment and infrastructure in the country told reporters in Dar es Salaam yesterday that the 2020/21 budget professionally mainstreams majority of Tanzanians’ lives. The institution’s Executive Secretary, Mr Ntimi Charles said the organization is satisfied with the way the budget has been tailored, terming it one of the best in East Africa. “I can say it is the best budget in East Africa because it has considered ordinary wananchi, who really want to improve their lives, we are happy because all these have been possible because of good leadership from President John Magufuli,” he said. He said the budget has focused on eradicating poverty, creating job opportunities, strengthening war against corruption and ensuring good governance as well as maintaining peace and order. “When we talk about the people’s budget, we focus on issues that benefit majority wananchi such as water services, health services, quality education, improved infrastructure and other things of such nature,” he noted. Earlier, Mr Ntimi said his organisation stands with the Parliament on its declaration to applaud President Magufuli for his strong leadership in the fight against Covid-19. He said his office wrote to the Speaker on the matter and that they were happy for the measure taken by the National Assembly in recognizing the Head of State’s efforts in fighting the scourge.
