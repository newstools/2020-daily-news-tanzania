KATAVI regional mining center transacted gold weighing 233 kilogramme valued at 21.8bn/-in the last one year. The facility opened for business last May registered a big success in a short span in comparison to its establishment before. Making the revelation here on Thursday, Katavi Regional Commissioner (RC), Mr Juma Homera said that before the institution was established merely 139 grammes last May would be registered in comparison to 30 kg this May. “The increase is as a result of businesspeople holding dealer licenses selling their gold direct at the center,” the RC said. The Chairman of Katavi small scale artisans, Mr Willy Mbogo said the number of mine dealers, who are selling gold direct to the center have increased enormously, adding the move is due to the encouragement and transparency of the government exhibited at the center that also handles other minerals. Meanwhile Mr Homera said during the 2019/20 the region targeted to realize 6,172,698 kilograms, adding that three companies Patl, Petrobena and Grand Tobacco have so far purchased 1.42million kg valued at 4.809bn/-. The RC said tobacco buyers should strictly adhere to their contracts signed with the government which stipulate clearly that they must purchase all tobacco at the end of July.
