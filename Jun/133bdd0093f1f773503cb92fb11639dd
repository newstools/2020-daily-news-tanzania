SINGIDA United have vowed to die in their jerseys on the battlefield to win all nine remaining matches of the league so as to clear relegation hurdle. This was said by the team's Head Coach, Ramadhani Nswan- zurimo who said they will use the available resources to ensure that they play again next season. "We have already started preparation ahead of league resumption on June 13th as one way to make sure that we win most of our remaining matches but the only thing I can say is that we will not retreat or surrender. "Of course, there will be a problem of match fitness among players since they stayed for a long time without playing football but all in all, there is no way out other than heading to the battlefield," he said. He added that his side has got youth players who are ready to put it all on the battle zone to help their team sustain in the competition for the upcoming season. Also, the club's Director, Festo Sanga reiterated that they have what it takes to avoid relegation next season while insisting that there is no way they are going to farewell the league. "As the management, we are united than ever before to propel the team towards victory in the upcoming nine games and that is our main priority," Sanga said. Sanga once opposed the government directives of letting all remaining matches in the Mainland Premier League to unfold in Dar es Salaam saying it is very expensive and unfair mainly to the teams which have more games at their backyard. "There are many advantages when playing at home since you have full backing from your fans and you know well your pitch unlike with the proposed system of playing at one center," he said. From 29 games, Singida United have won only three matches, draw 6 encounters and lose 20 matches to pocket 15 points and remain at the bottom place of the table after scoring 16 goals and conceding 49 goals respectively.
