SPECIAL Seats Lawmaker, Rukia Kassim Ahmed (CUF), has requested the government to bar uncircumcised men from marrying, as researches show that they are the main cause of cervical cancer to women. In her main question to the Ministry of Health, Community Development, Gender Elderly and Children in the National Assembly, the MP said it had been confirmed that cervical cancer is caused by viruses that are obtained in uncircumcised men. “When will the government restrict uncircumcised men from marriage to rescue our women from contracting the disease?’’ she asked. In a written response, the ministry said yesterday that cervical cancer is caused by Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) and that the disease was mainly caused through having an intercourse with an infected person. However, it was quick to point out that there were no plans to restrict uncircumcised men from marriage. “Not every woman who encounters HPV suffers cervical cancer, but the disease can be obtained after a person remains with the virus for a long time (persistence infection),’’ said the ministry. The ministry further said that the delay in seeking treatment was likely to lead to cervical cancer. “Equally, it should be noted that there are other causes of cervical cancer including beginning sex at early ages, tobacco consumption as well as people living with HIV/AIDS. “In this regard, the ministry stated it had no plans whatsoever to ban uncircumcised men to marry,’’ said the government, adding: “The ministry has put strategies in place to prevent cervical cancer including vaccinating girls aged between 9 and 14 years countrywide.” Apart from the vaccine, the ministry said that it will continue giving massive education on behavioural change including awareness campaigns on male circumcision.
