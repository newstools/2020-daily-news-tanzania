BONGO Flavor star Rajab Kahali 'Harnonize' has requested the government to also consider giving them green light to resume staging music performances as they now face acute economic hardships. Despite the state allowing sport activities to restart after nearly two months of suspension due to Covid-19 pandemic, public gatherings are still restricted. But speaking in Dar es Salaam recently, Harmonize voiced out the request on behalf of his colleagues saying they too want to be allowed to start live shows. "Let me take this opportunity to request the government via the Minister for Information, Culture, Arts and Sports, Harrison Mwakyembe to consider us just like the way they have done to sport events. "By giving us the go ahead to resume performing, it will surely help a lot to recover from economic setback we have been facing ever since the ban of social activities," said him. Asked if he is ready to work with legend Bongo Flavor artiste Ali Kiba, Harmonize said he will be grateful to work with him. "We all know that love is the most important thing. If we work in unity, we will be able to build the nation together and that is very important to achieve, "the 'Uno'Â  hit maker said. Responding to a question raised by one of his fans about why he abandoned all the beautiful ladies in the country to cross boarders and marry Sarah Michelotti, the singer said love has no boundaries. "We are being taught to love one another regardless where they come from. Love is all about passion such that you can love anybody from anywhere and by marrying her, it does not mean that our girls are not beautiful," he said. Harmonize secretly married his Italian wife last year in Dar es Salaam after organising a special ceremony which was attended by few invited people.
