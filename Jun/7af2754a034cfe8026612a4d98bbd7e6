COOPERATIVE societies will go digital after the Tanzania Cooperative Development Commission (TCDC) launched the electronic technology in a bid to bring services closer to the people. Speaking during the launch of a digital system, Registrar of Cooperative Unions, Dr Benson Ndiege, noted that the digital system was set to improve the control of cooperative unions. “All cooperative societies will now register online and its members will be able to access information of the cooperative unions online,” said the registrar. Dr Ndiege said the government had decided to introduce the digital system to address a number of challenges facing cooperative unions in the country, saying the new system would address challenges facing cooperative union members as they had to travel long distances to the headquarters to collect and submit registration forms. “The digital system will also address transport costs incurred by cooperative union members, who have been travelling to the headquarters to submit registration documents,” he said. Dr Ndiege explained that the digital system would also help the TCDC to monitor the performance of cooperative unions. “The digital system will help TCDC monitor different reports of the cooperative unions and facilitate registration of the cooperative unions,” he said. Dr Ndiege noted that the government had introduced the National Microeconomics Policy of 2017 to improve the performance of cooperative unions, saying to implement the national policy, the government had enacted the Microeconomics Act in 2018. For his part, Chairman of Tanesco Saccos Thomas Samo expressed gratitude to the commission for improving the cooperative unions' performance, noting that the unions had continued improving. He used the occasion to appeal to all cooperative unions to register online and acquire licences to run their activities in accordance with the Microeconomics Act.
