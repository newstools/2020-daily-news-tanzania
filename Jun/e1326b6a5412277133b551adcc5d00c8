THE Ministry of State in the Presidentâ€™s Office responsible for Public Service Management and Good Governance will start operating from Zanzibar after being allocated office space by Zanzibar government, a move that aims to strengthen relations. "We have to enhance our union; it is fortunate that our services are now extended to Zanzibar. We thank our colleagues here," the Ministry of State, President's Office Public Service Management (PO-PSM) and Good Government, Permanent Secretary, Dr Laurean Ndumbaro said. Since employment is among the activities of the Ministry, Ndumbaro advised people, particularly the youth in the Isles to seek for help at the office as soon as it begins operations. He said travel inconveniences and costs for people applying for jobs in the union government will soon end after the 'Utumishi' office opens in Zanzibar, urging them to fully utilize the office. Dr Ndumbaro thanked the Zanzibar government for providing the office, which is a result of ongoing collaboration between the two ministries and discussions in the union on how best to serve citizens, and that his office will continue with awareness about their presence in the Isles. During the handover ceremony, the Zanzibar's Ministry of Public Service and Good governance Permanent Secretary (PS) Mr Yakout Hassan Yakout said "We will share experiences about handling different issues dealt with by our offices." "We need to maintain our relationship in the union government, and this is one of the ways of strengthening our relations," said Mr Yakout.
