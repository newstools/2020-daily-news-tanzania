YOUNG Africans are expected to jet off today for Shinyanga, ready to confront Mwadui FC in their 28th Mainland Premier League match at CCM Kambarage Stadium on Saturday. It will be a must win affair for both sides with the hosts desperate to stamp a victory to pocket three crucial points and be able to move up on the ladder, while the visitors too are eyeing for the triumph. Prior to the game, Yanga had two strength testing matches against Trans Camp, which they won 2-0 and the other versus KMC, which they lost 3-0 at Uhuru Stadium in Dar es Salaam. Speaking on Tuesday, the club’s Information Officer Hassan Bumbuli said they have communicated with Head Coach Luc Eymael from Belgium, who he said has shown interest to travel with the team to Shinyanga. “There are two options such that if we travel tomorrow (today), he will join us in Shinyanga or we may decide to wait for him to travel together on Thursday,” he said. He added that all the programmes, which were being implemented by Assistant Coach Charles Boniface Mkwasa, were drafted and sent by Eymael, insisting that the coach is fully aware about the status of the team despite his absence. “I do not understand the argument of some people that the coach should be given time to rest and let Mkwasa take care of the team in the upcoming two league matches,” said Bumbuli. Commenting on the friendly loss, he said they were winners rather than losers on condition that they learnt many things. “If we had won, the team could have been satisfied but after losing, it gave us an opportunity to see where we need to improve for the sake of doing well in league encounters,” he said. From 27 games played, Yanga are third on the table with 51 points, 20 points behind leaders Simba, who remain sharp to defend the title for three times in a row.
