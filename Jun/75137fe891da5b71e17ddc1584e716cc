Thousands of Malians joined a protest rally in the capital Bamako on Friday to demand the resignation of President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita over what they say is his mishandling of many crises plaguing the West African nation. Keita, re-elected in 2018 for a second five-year term, is struggling with a years-long security crisis in northern Mali, an outbreak of the new corona-virus and political tensions arising from a disputed legislative election in March. Various political groups and human rights activists helped organise Friday’s demonstration, which had the backing of influential Muslim cleric Mahmoud Dicko. “I’m here today to tell President IBK (the widely used initials of Keita’s names) that he is incompetent and that he cannot govern this country. He should resign,” Moussa Traore, an unemployed man in his 30s, told Reuters. Some protesters brandished placards that read “IBK must go” and “No to bad governance”.
