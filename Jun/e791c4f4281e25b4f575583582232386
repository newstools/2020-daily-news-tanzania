He said the incident happened on May 31, this year at around 9.30 p.m. He said the suspect accused his mother of being a drunkard who left his sick father unattended. Initial investigations revealed that on the material date, Theopista went to Omukagando trading centre where she indulged in a drinking spree. As she was heading home, she met the suspect who inquired where she had been all the time, a situation that sparked a quarrel, prompting the suspect to assault the old lady with several blows. She fell down unconscious before neighbors rushed her to the nearby Mabira Health Centre, but she was pronounced dead upon arrival.Â  A massive hunt was ongoing to arrest the suspect. In another incident, Hamish Lushiku (36), a resident of Igabiro village in Bukoba District is helping police in investigations after he allegedly stabbed his wife, identified as Happiness Ibrahim (33) to death.
