TANZANIA Media Women’s Association (Tamwa—Zanzibar) at the weekend congratulated three women describing them as courageous for deciding to join the CCM presidential race. The gender activist organisation commended Ms Mwantum Mussa Sultan, Ms Hasna Attai and Ms Fatma Kombo Masoud, who have already collected CCM nomination papers for the Zanzibar presidency. “Tamwa considers Ms Sultan, Ms Attai and Ms Masoud as courageous women worth entering a record book of the Zanzibar history,” Tamwa Zanzibar Director Dr Mzuri Issa said in a statement. She appreciated the women, likening them to Ambassador Amina Salum Ali who first entered the 2000 Zanzibar presidential race and later in the 2015 general election tried her luck in the Union presidency through CCM. Dr Issa urged Zanzibaris to support the three women and encourage other female presidential hopefuls to join the race in search of gender equality in top decision making organs. “As the exercise to collect nomination forms continues in Zanzibar, Tamwa-Zanzibar wishes to see more women from CCM picking nomination papers and vying for various posts as part of their constitutional and democratic rights. It should be noted that Zanzibar has a track record of women’s participation in independence struggles to demand freedom, which includes opposing openly and transparently any kind of oppression by colonists while many men were scared,” said Dr Issa.
