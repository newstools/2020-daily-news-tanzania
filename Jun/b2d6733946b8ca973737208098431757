NMB Bank has donated building materials worth 5m/-towards the construction of Makambini Health Centre. The centre caters mostly for Covid-19 patients, who would be identified in Tunduma District, Songwe Region. Releasing the materials to Tunduma Council Executive Director, Regina Bieda, NMB Mbalazi Road branch, Hamadan Silliah, who is also Highland Zone, acting Manager, said the donation was part of his bank’s ploughing back to the communities sourced from accrued profit it makes in business. Mr Silliah said the branch initially received the request to assist in the construction of the health centre, and coincidentally the bank had that in mind in its Corporate Social Responsibility to support such community projects especially on health and education as well as other calamities. He said the bank services in the region have also improved including the initiated digital banking that was limiting physical visit to the institution for financial matters, especially in the wake of coronavirus that spreads easily in crowded places. On her part, Tunduma Council Executive Director, Ms Bieda said the health centre that has two Wards for women and men, still requires about 95m/- for it to be completely finished and furnished. Presiding over the donation, Momba District Commissioner, Juma Irando said the bank’s assistance would first go towards constructing a room to treat any case of coronavirus in the area, before some would be directed towards other construction activities. He said the health centre that lies across the border to Zambia on one’s way to other SADC countries, also caters for other patients from outside the country including DRC, adding that, before it was urgently set up to fight Ebola in the bloc and now turned to address Covid-19 pandemic.
