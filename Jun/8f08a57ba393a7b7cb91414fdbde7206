IMMEDIATELY after he took oath of office on November 5, 2015, President John Magufuli appointed Judge George Masaju as the new Attorney General (AG) of the United Republic of Tanzania. Judge Masaju, who also served in the fourth phase government under retired President Jakaya Kikwete was by then appointed to replace former AG, Judge Frederic Werema, who retired in December 2014 over the Tegeta escrow scandal. Appointment of the AG is done in fulfillment of Article 59 of the Constitution of the United Republic of Tanzania that among other things, tasks the person to be an adviser of the government on matters of law. Also, Article 59 (5) provides that by the virtue of the office, AG is a Member of Parliament and also an ex officio member of the Cabinet. The 11th Parliament that has drawn to an end has been served by two AGs, where the first one was Justice Masaju who started in November 2015 and ended in January 30 2018, and followed by the current one, Prof Adelardus Kilangi, who ascended to the office on February 1st, 2018 after Mr Masaju was appointed a Judge of the High Court. During his tenure as the AG, between November 6 2015 and January 31 2018, Justice Masaju engineered establishments of 21 Bills and Amendments of more than eight laws. List of Bills that were tabled included- The Access to Information Bill, 2016,The Appropriation Bill, 2016,The Chemist Professionals Bill, 2016,The Copyright and Neighbouring Rights (Copyrighted Works- Communication to the Public) Regulations), Bill 2016, and The Finance Bill, 2016.

The Acts require the government to own at least a 16 per cent share in the newly established mining firm, Twiga Mineral Corporation with the remaining 84 per cent shares being owned by Barrick gold mines. This has assured the government of full supervision and participation in making decisions at the North Mara, Bulyanhulu and Buzwagi Mines as well as increasing royalty tax on gold and other minerals.
