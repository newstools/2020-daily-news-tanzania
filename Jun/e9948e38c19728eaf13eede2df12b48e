THE nation may have many strong and valuable entrepreneurs should the country have an ‘entrepreneurship policy’ in place, stakeholders have said. Discussing ‘entrepreneurship development’ as an opportunity for youth, including graduates from higher learning institutions, the stakeholders observed that lack of policy continues to hamper entrepreneurship growth in the country. In a stakeholders meeting which involved officers from the State University of Zanzibar (SUZA), Small and Medium Industrial Development Agency (SMIDA), Milele Zanzibar Foundation (MZF), Ministry responsible for economic empowerment, and some youth organizations, participants said reforms are crucial in developing entrepreneurs. The meeting was organised by CUBE-Zanzibar (a start-up and business enabler that offers a range of support services to start-ups and small businesses in Zanzibar). It provides ideation, incubation and acceleration programs to (aspiring) entrepreneurs and supports startups (with focus on youths), by assisting in financing and business administration challenges.
