IN a bid to penetrate wider markets, Serengeti Breweries Limited (SBL) yesterday launched new beer pack targeting consumers in the Lake zone regions. The brewer that sources locally barley, maize and sorghum for its beer production said the new Pilsner larger pack will be available to customers throughout the Lake zone regions at reasonable price. The SBL Company has of recent grown its cereal uptake from zero to 15,000 metric tonnes of grain which is equivalent to 60 per cent of the total raw materials needed for beer production per year. SBL said the new beer pack is intended to give consumers and the market more and best choices. “The residents from the lake zone regions who are famed for their hardworking spirit will enjoy Pilsner lager 300ml dubbed ‘imara kama simba’ at affordable retail prices,” the SBL Head of Beer, Anitha Msangi has said. Incorporated in 1988 as Associated Breweries, SBL is the second largest beer company in Tanzania, with its beer brands accounting for over 20 per cent of the market by volume. SBL has three operating plants in Dar es Salaam, Mwanza and Moshi. Through the years, East African brew masters have maintained this unique process which involves cold filtering the beer giving it that superior liquid clarity and authentic taste. Since the creation of SBL in 2002, the business has grown its portfolio of brands year on year. The majority stake acquisition by EABL/Diageo in 2010 has seen increased investment in international quality standards leading to greater job opportunities for the people of Tanzania.
