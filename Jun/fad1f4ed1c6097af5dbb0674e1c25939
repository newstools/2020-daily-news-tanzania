TANZANIA Mortgage Refinance (TMRC), has joined efforts to keep Tanzanians safe from Covid-19 by donating protective equipment to heath facilities to combat the pandemic. The company argued that mortgage sector also needed healthy people for housing development. In realising this, the TMRC over the weekend donated sanitizers to Amana Regional Referral Hospital to help health workers perform their work safely. When handed over donation of 250 litres of sanitizers to the hospital, the TMRC said it was crucial for stakeholders to join fight against the pandemic. TMRC Executive Officer, Oscar Mgaya said the company donated to demonstrate its contribution to fight against the disease. Mr Mgaya said, â€œas an institution we found it necessary to give our small contribution to beef up fight against the pandemic at Amana Referral Hospital," Principal Doctor of the Amana Regional Referral Hospital, Dr Amani Malima, received the donation during a brief event at the hospital. Dr Malima thanked the government for cooperation it accorded to the hospital, particularly after selecting it as one of centres designated for Covid-19 patients in the city. He also commended the TMRC for the support which would positively contribute to helping the health staff protect themselves from contracting the global virus. He appealed to other institutions to borrow leaf from the TMRC in joining hands to end the Covid-19 in the country. Dr Malima said up to Friday last week the hospital remained with only one patient of Covid-19, something which showed that the infection rate of the disease has successfully been contained in the country. He however called upon the public to continue observing precautionary measures as advised by the health experts to avoid contracting the virus and enable zero infection of the disease in the country.
