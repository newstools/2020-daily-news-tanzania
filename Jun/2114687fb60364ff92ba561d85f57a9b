The number of confirmed cases of coronavirus worldwide is now above 6.9 million, according to latest figures collated by Johns Hopkins University. The US has by far the largest number of cases, accounting for almost 30% of the global total. It also has the world's highest death toll, followed by the UK and Brazil. In Europe, Italy, France and Spain have also been badly hit while in China - where the virus was first detected - the official death toll is some 4,600 from about 84,000 confirmed cases, although critics have questioned whether the country's official numbers can be trusted. Meanwhile, Brazil has removed from public view months of historical data on its epidemic and stopped giving a total count of cases. Globally, the true number of cases is thought to be much higher than reported figures, as many of those with milder symptoms have not been tested and counted.
