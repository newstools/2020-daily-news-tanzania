Arusha Regional Police Commander Jonathan Shana has been transferred to the Tanzania Police School (CCP), few days after President John Magufuli’s warned his appointees against falling short of his expectations. The quick reshuffle will see the flamboyant cop assume the roles of a Human Resources Manager at the Kilimanjaro based institute which is revered for churning out skilled and professional police officers. Shana who earned himself the nickname of a ‘dancing cop’ due to his dancing moves   in rallies and other public functions, deemed his transfer a ‘normal’ thing in the country’s police hierarchy , assuring that he was determined to hit the ground running as he assumes his new post. Before his Arusha appointment, ACP Shana was the Mwanza Police Regional boss until March last year. Meanwhile, the Prevention and Combating of Corruption Bureau (PCCB) regional boss, Ms Frida Wekesi has been transferred to Dodoma region.
