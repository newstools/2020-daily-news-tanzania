IT is all smiles for workers as the government on Thursday proposed to increase the taxable income threshold from 170,000/- to 270,000/- per month in the coming financial year 2020/2021. The increase is equivalent to a 58.8 per cent increase and implies that the threshold for taxable income per annum will increase to 3,240,000/- from 2,040,000/-. Tabling the 2020/21 national budget estimates in the House yesterday, the Minister for Finance and Planning, Dr Philip Mpango said the increase aims at improving workers welfare and Tanzanians’ lives in general.

According to Dr Mpango, the move seeks to provide tax relief to Primary Cooperatives Societies including SACCOS since they have small capital. The government also proposed amendments on the EAC Customs Management Act, 2004 to give relief for supplies for diag nosis, prevention, treatment, and management of epidemics, pandemics and health hazards as the region battles the Covid-19.
