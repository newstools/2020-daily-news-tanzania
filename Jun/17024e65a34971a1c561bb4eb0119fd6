NDANDA FC Head Coach, Abdul Mingange said absence of his three key players was the reason for their 2-0 defeat from Namungo FC in a friendly match at Nangwanda Sijaona Stadium over the weekend. The two sides met to reignite morale for their players before the top flight league officially resumes on June 13th after nearly two months of league suspension due to Covid-19 pandemic. However, both teams are set to meet again for a reverse friendly duel early this week at Majaliwa Stadium in Ruangwa, Lindi. "We have lost and our opponents had a good game especially in the second half but we lacked three key players who could have had an impact during the game. "This was just a friendly match and I am certain that by June 20th when normal league fixtures will start to unfold, my team will be in positive mood to embrace the contest," he said. Commenting on the red card given to one of his players on the day, Mingange said it was a good decision from the referee since his player really committed the foul. "Players who play in the Mainland Premier League are not supposed to commit silly mistakes and I have no doubt with the flashed red card to him," said he. On his part, Namungo coach Thiery Hitimana said he was satisfied with what he got from the match even though coordination among his charges is yet to be achieved. "The intensity of the game was low possibly because players spent long time off the pitch that is why unity was not easily seen but we still have more days to correct the displayed shortfalls," he said. Ndanda are placed 16th on the table with 31 points from 29 matches, a position which make them not completely safe as far as relegation battle is concerned. On the other hand, Namungo who have had a perfect season so far are fourth on the ladder with 50 points after 29 encounters and still have a chance to climb up the log if they win most of their oncoming matches.
