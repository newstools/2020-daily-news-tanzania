AUTHORITIES in Dodoma are considering mass eviction of street hawkers, who resort to playing near government and other restricted buildings. The City’s Marketing Officer, James Yuna, said though the traders were operating illegally, they were also idling and causing unnecessary chaos around. Addressing leaders of the traders in the city on Tuesday, the officer said their activities have been interfering with office works in the neighbourhood, especially their disturbing noise and their customers. “We have noticed traders fixing their tables close to restricted office buildings, and their activities result into endless noise and disturbance to office occupants...we want such traders to vacate to allow the legal occupants freely use their space,” he said. However, he urged the leaders to be goodwill ambassadors to the other traders and see into that they follow the city’s rules and regulations, saying: “As leaders you can participate by providing education during their daily operations. “We expect leaders to be the shield, and luckily there has never been any confrontation between them and the authority.” The traders’ leaders had expressed readiness to work with the government in ensuring their activities are in line with the city’s requirements. Commenting, Sabasaba Complex Petty Traders Chairperson, Edward Ndahani, said his leadership would ensure that traders there help the government in removing all illegally built kiosks. He said the process would also involve removing business premises, which have remained dormant for years in the area and in turn become dens of criminals. “I understand every one of us has some stores in their area which have no use, we must work together to remove such stores to ensure we also preserve the environment,” he noted. On his part, Dodoma District petty traders’ chairperson, Baraka Mrisho, called upon the traders to work together and observe laws set by the government.
