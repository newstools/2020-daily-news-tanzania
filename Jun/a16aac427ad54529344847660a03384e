CHIEF Justice, Prof Ibrahim Juma, has called for adherence of guidelines and ethics among the judiciary for a vibrant industry. He gave the call here when opening a meeting on judiciary ethics committee, where he said strict adherence of the guidelines and ethics is of paramount importance for the industry’s growth. “The reputation of the judiciary depends on how much we live by the code of conduct and observing ethics, let us embrace them,” said Prof Juma. He told the committee that those who do not abide by the ethics should be dealt with because they are supposed to follow guidelines for a good image of the judicial institution. However, he cautioned that there must be demarcations in the operations of the administration and judicial operations for more efficiency and accountability of the operations. The Chief Justice insisted on the need for employees, public, magistrates and judges to know the details of the ethics guidelines so that they can abide by them. “Overseeing ethics is of paramount importance, time is up for each and every one of us to abide by them, and we will be guided by them, thus accountability and good governance at all level will be observed,” he said. On his part, Principal Judge, Dr Eliezer Feleshi said abiding by ethics is key to all judicial staffs because it builds public confidence towards the institution. “Judicial servants must observe ethics, because it is an important aspect on how the public will build confidence and trust with our institution,” he insisted. He said ethics must be observed not only at the work place, but within the community because the public has a tendency of merging the two when weighing one’s reputation and match it with the institution he is attached to. Dr Feleshi said public servants should have deeds which are not questionable because it creates trust, accountability and good governance.
