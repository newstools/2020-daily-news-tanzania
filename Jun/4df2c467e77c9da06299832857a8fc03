TANZANIA Shipping Agency Cooperation (TASAC) has announced extension of a three months renewal of Certificate of Competency (CoC) to Tanzanian seafarers working on international and local ships due to renewal hardships caused by Covid-19 outbreak. CoC is a form of license renewed periodically which mariners, (including seafarers) are required to have before they work on ships. It has to comply with the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watch keeping for Seafarers (STCW). “TASAC has extended CoC renewal period for three months starting July 1 this year. this means that Tanzanian seafarers should be allowed to work by using their previous documents because the procedure was interrupted by a travel ban which was part of the efforts to curb the spread of Covid-19 ,” said Emanuel Ndomba, TASAC’s executive director. Ndomba, who was speaking during commemoration of the annual seafarers day in Dar es Salaam on Thursday, said that Tanzania had over 5,300 registered seafarers who meet international standards, some of whom are working locally and abroad. Failure to renew their CoC was part of the problems they found themselves in as countries imposed measures of curbing spread of the virus. He further said that seafarers have been facing difficulties in different parts of the world as they were attending their duties of delivering cargo which included food, medicines and medical equipment which are vital in fighting the respiratory disease. ‘In some parts of the countries, seafarers were denied entry as they were suspected of being infected with the virus and some were put under mandatory quarantine. They had no time to rest or be repatriated to their areas of origin or work as airlines were grounded,” he said.
