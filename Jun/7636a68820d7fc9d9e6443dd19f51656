ZANZIBAR Contractors Registration Board (ZCRB) envisages registering 60 contractors and 120 construction projects in the 2020/2021 fiscal year, the House of Representatives heard here Monday. Lands, Water and Energy Minister Salama Aboud Talib said the country’s regulator of the construction industry is determined to ensure that all construction projects are executed as per legislations to meet the required standards. Moving the ministry’s 2020/21 budget estimates, Minister Salama said the board will organise inspection tours of all construction projects in Unguja and Pemba to enforce adherence to the law. She said during the July 2019-March 2020, ZCRB registered 34 new contractors, with 13 of them from Zanzibar, 19 from Tanzania Mainland and two foreigners. The board also inspected 20 newly registered contractors and 34 other applicants who had submitted applications for registration. The board conducted 83 and 32 inspection tours of construction projects in Unguja and Pemba, respectively. Meanwhile, the Zanzibar Architects, Engineers and Quantity Surveyors Registration Board will in the next fiscal year focus on enhancement of civil engineering professionals, including graduates, technicians and construction companies. Through special programmes, the minister said, the board will continue equipping construction professionals with the requisite skills for execution of projects at the prescribed standards.
