COASTAL Union coach Juma Mgunda has hailed his teamâ€™s tactical discipline after a massive comeback to draw 2-2 with Namungo FC at Mkwakwani Stadium in Tanga over the weekend. The battle involved the fourth-placed league occupants; Namungo and the fifth-placed Coastal Union, with each team fighting lungs out to claim vital three points, but at the end, a draw was inevitable. "We had to change our game plan in the second half upon seeing that we were trailing by two goals. We had to begin the last half with extra energy which helped us to equalise both goals," Mgunda said. He continued: "Our opponents started the match with high tempo no wonder they succeeded to score two quick goals as such, at half-time, we had to change our approach." Moreover, Mgunda said a point was much better even though their target was to bag all three points from their home territory. "Players spent almost 74 days without playing competitive football and just trained for ten days. You can see that the level of fitness is yet to come back," said him. On his part, Namungo FC coach Thiery Hitimana said they knew that the game would be difficult since Coastal Union are chasing them. "Our mission was not to lose this game and to maintain the four points gap between us which we have accomplished and one point is enough for us. "We had a good first half and they enjoyed the last half after succeeding to net twice. I think home ground morale from their fans is what made them shine in the second half," he lamented. On whether the absence of some of his key players in the squad like Lucas Kikoti contributed to the final outcome, Hitimana said they have enough players such that if others are missing, it becomes an opportunity for other players to play. Namungo continue to sit on fourth slot of the log with 51 points while Coastal Union maintain their fifth place with 47 points after 29 encounters each.
