AS of December, 2019, the government distributed a total of 31,955 tonnes of cotton seeds to farmers in all the districts growing the cash crop in the country, the Ministry of Agriculture has confirmed. According to the government, as of March 2020, some 2,454,602 bottles of pesticides had been distributed to farmers, being part of the targeted 4,000,000 bottles of pesticides. The government said this in a written response to a question asked by the Busega MP, Dr Raphael Chegeni (CCM), who had wanted to know what the government was doing to help cotton farmers who are faced with a lot of challenges. He argued that cotton farmers were faced with a lot of challenges, including lack of farm inputs like fertilizer and the rising cost every year. “Most cotton farmers are beset by serious poverty due to unreliable supply of inputs as well as costs of production. What is the government doing to save them?” he asked. In response, the government explained that some of the steps taken include production of improved cotton seeds at Igunga and Kasekese in Tanganyika District Council in Katavi Region. Another step, the ministry said, was compiling records of all cotton farmers in the country for easy coordination, enabling them to access cotton inputs. The ministry told the parliament that seed purchases is done through the bulk procurement system, in efforts to ensure easy access to all farmers. On the other hand, some 4,532 lead farmers have been trained and joined through a network of extension officers. According to the ministry, the government, in collaboration with the private sector and other development partners, have consistently improved extension services, providing 27 motorbikes and 13 vehicles to extension officers .
