THE Police Force says whereas investigations over the alleged attack on Mr Freeman Mbowe, the leader of the opposition camp and Chadema national chairman are underway, a cloud of mystery hangs over the event. A statement issued here yesterday and signed by the Police Force Spokesperson, David Misime, said initial investigations have revealed that the high profile politician was heavily drunk. “Investigations show that on the material day, Mr Mbowe was so drunk that he was incoherent in his speech,” Misime explained, adding: “It has come to our attention that on the material day, Mr Mbowe drank alcohol in a number of pubs, including Royal Village.” Mr Misime said investigations into the issue were ongoing, calling upon whoever had any information on the issue to submit it to the police force. The Police Force Spokesperson said there were discrepancies between the nature of the incident and Mr Mbowe’s explanations. He explained that no-one rushed to his aid as he was yelling during the presumed attack, save for his driver. He explained, however, that, surprisingly, instead of the incident being reported to the Police, Mr Mbowe was driven to the house of his coparent, Ms Joyce Mukya, a Chadema Special Seats MP, in whose house Mr Mbowe had earlier been before being driven to his house. The police officer said it was intriguing why a close relative of the top Chadema official, one James Mbowe, who was in the compound, was not alerted on the presumed nasty goings-in, and Ms Mukya was instead deemed more appropriate to be drawn into the picture. Other questions surrounding the incident are on why Mr Mbowe, who was subsequently flown to Dar es Salaam for specialized treatment, didn’t have a security detail while returning home that night.
