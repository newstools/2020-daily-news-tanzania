THIS is going to set record of being the longest cycling race in the country, topping at 360 kilometres and taking three consecutive days next September. Dubbed ‘Tanzania Heritage Tour,’ the maiden bicycle racing is slated to be flagged off on September 11th to 13th this year under the organisation of the Arusha based, ‘Rexlex Cycling’ Company, in conjunction with the local cycling association here. According to the Secretary General of Arusha Cycling Association (ARCA), Joel Senny, more than 100 riders from all over the country, including Zanzibar will participate in the so-called ‘Stage Tour’ cycling event. The cycling tour will be flagged off from Arusha City, heading to Mirerani Mining Hills of Simanjiro, in Manyara Region, where the youth aged between 15 years and 45 years will make a stop at the Great Mirerani Wall, surrounding Tanzanite Gemstones Mines. On the second day, the second leg of the tour will see the riders returning to Arusha and diverting into Arusha National Park, then cycle within the attraction before heading to Engikaret animal corridor on the third day and also touch the highlands of Mount Meru. “In this bicycle tour, we aim at branding the country, promoting tourism after the Covid-19 lockdown around the world, boost youth health, create entertainment and provide employment for young people,” stated Senny. As it happens, the main 360 km race will involve male cyclists, while women cyclists will cover 300 km, a lesser distance which will also be undertaken by older riders as well as younger youths at the rate of 100 kilometres per day. In warming up for the grand ‘Tanzania Tour’ the ARCA is organising three mini bicycle racing competitions at the end of this month, then in July (Saba-Saba Day) and August. Meanwhile, the association has warned cyclists who like to practice on roads, should first notify ARCA officials, so that they can be assisted in case of anything.
