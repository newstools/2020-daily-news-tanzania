ZANZIBAR Football Federation (ZFF) has appointed Ali Ame Vuai to serve the federation’s secretary general post which was previously held by Mohammed Ali Hilal. His appointment comes immediately after the end of Hilal’s contract, ac cording to the federation’s spokesman Adam Natepe. He, however, said Vuai will serve the federation as an acting secretary general while a process to appoint the permanent one is underway. “He will just act on the post until the time we get the one who can serve the post permanently,” explained Natepe. He said several prominent figures have been nominated for the post, including the Khamis Abdalla Said, who previously vied for ZFF presidential post, the ZFF Competition secretary Hussein Ahmada and the former Zanzibar Heroes coach, Suleiman Mahmoud Jabir. The Zanzibar Football Federation (ZFF) is the governing football Federation for Zanzibar, Africa. The ZFF was an associate member of the African governing body, the Confederation of African Football. Following a rejection from FIFA in 2005, the ZFA was removed from CAF and after much lobbying were reinstated as an associate member. As a nation state, it has competed in regional competitions since 1949. It currently competes in CECAFA organised tournaments.
