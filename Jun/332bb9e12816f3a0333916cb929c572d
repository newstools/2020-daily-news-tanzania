TANZANIA Petroleum Development Corporation (TPDC), is finalizing payment logistic for acquiring more than 100-acres at Zuzu area on the city outskirt for the construction of oil reserve tanks. TPDC Community Development Officer, Ms Delian Kabwogi, while speaking to residents, commended them for giving room for the construction of the oil reserve which is of paramount importance to people in the central zone regions. “We are finalizing payment logistic for your compensation, and we are here today to ensure that you have active bank accounts, passport size photos and other details needed for the contract,” she said. She told them that the petroleum reserve will ensure reliability and availability of fuel not only to the central zone regions but also to neighbouring countries. Ms Kabwogi said the fuel will be transported from Dar es Salaam to Dodoma through the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR), where the reserve tanks will be constructed adjacent to it. “Dodoma is centre to many regions, therefore the construction will ease the duration to other areas, and at the same time our roads will last for long, because fuel will be transported through the SGR,” she insisted. She said TPDC is expected to sign a payment contract with the residents today so that early next week they can start paying compensation to the area residents. Speaking during the awareness meeting, Zuzu local government chairman, Mr Salvatory Olesaitabdu warned the beneficiaries over reselling of the compensated land, which he said warrants as a criminal offence. He said with the land areas that have not been covered under the agreement, they should not develop then until TPDC, SGR, ring-roads and energy projects that pass through the area have set up their beacons.
