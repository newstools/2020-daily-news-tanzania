GWAMBINA FC head coach Fulgence Novatus has applauded his players’ commitment in their 1-0 victory over Alliance FC in a friendly match at Gwambina complex in Misungwi on Wednesday. The match’s solitary goal was netted by Meshack Abraham in the 37th minute after connecting an assist from Jacob Massawe. Speaking after the match, Novatus said all players played well and managed to control the game in all departments. He said he was satisfied with the team’s overall performance despite facing strong opposition from the visitors. Novatus, the former Namungo FC, Toto African and Stand United coach, said his team managed to win because Alliance FC team lost steam in the last 70 minutes after playing very well in the first 20 minutes only. “However, it wasn’t an easy game, Alliance FC played very well in the first 20 minutes, they attacked too much and we had very good tactics in the field and we tried to close all their scoring gaps,” he said Alliance FC head coach Kessy Mziray said his team played well despite minor mistakes committed by his strikers and defenders. He promised to rectify their mistakes so as to win the next Saturday match against Mbeya City at Sokoine Memorial stadium. Alliance FC, who are struggling to avoid relegation are placed 18th on the log after gathering 29 points from 29-game outings. They have won five, drawn seven and lost 14 matches.
