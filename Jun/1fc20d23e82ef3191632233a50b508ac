THE government is set to ban the importation of milk two years from now, Minister for Livestock and Fisheries Development Luhaga Mpina has said. He directed the Tanzania Dairy Board and other milk stakeholders to prepare and come up with initiatives that will lead to the increase of investments for local milk production before the ban. Mr Mpina made the announcement when officiating at the climax of National Milk Promotion Week organized in Dodoma Region. “I call upon the milk board and other stakeholders to come up with plans that will ensure the increase of local production within two years from now in order to stop importation of milk,” he said, noting that Tanzania had enough arable land with abundant required resources, including daily cattle with the capacity to produce enough milk in the country. He said the board and other stakeholders involved should ensure that the country produced all kinds of milk requirements, including those with special ingredients normally imported to feed children and other people with special needs. Mr Mpina also tasked local milk processors, in collaboration with the national daily board to ensure that milk products such as those imported on exemptions through UNICEF to help increase nutrients in children are produced here. He said a year from now, UNICEF will not be allowed to import the milk freely into the country, reiterating the need for local producers, processors and others involved to ensure that all milk products are produced locally. He said the move will help forex savings, create jobs as well as encouraging the broad investments for local milk production in the country.
