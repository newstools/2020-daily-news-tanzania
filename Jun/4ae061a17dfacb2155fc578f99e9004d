MKURANGA District Council in Coast Region has been urged to come up with new sources of income so as to expand its tax and revenue collections which will help in guaranteeing economic growth in the district. Coast Regional Commissioner (RC), Eng. Evarist Ndikilo made the remarks at the special Councilors meeting to discuss Controller and Auditor General (CAG), reports for the last financial year in Mkuranga District recently. “I commend you for getting a clean certificate from the CAG for the fourth consecutive year. However, I would like to ask the District Executive Director (DED), and your team to thoroughly supervise the available sources of income and at the same time work to come up with more new ones”, he said. Eng. Ndikilo also congratulated the Council for its modern bus stand project in Mwandege ward, adding that if managed well it could bring a lot of income to the Council. He went on to say that the district was doing very well in revenue and tax collections compared to other districts in the region pointing out that up to last week a total of revenues and taxes that has been collected for this financial year had reached a total of 5.99bn/-which is equal to 95 percent while the target was to collect a total of 6.31bn/-. On the other hand, the RC took time to ask DED and his team to be more serious in supervising revenue collections and deal with those who are obstructing their efforts in reaching their targets. In addition to that, he reminded the Council’s Internal Auditor, Ms Faidha Kassim to make sure that all remaining queries from the CAG reports get clear response as well as continuing with providing updates on implementation of CAG recommendations now and then.
