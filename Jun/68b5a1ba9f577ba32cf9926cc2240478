THE government has been advised to come up with an online application system that will fast track the issuance of land title deeds. With the technological advancement, the online application system is the best choice as the commissioner of lands may approve the title deeds regardless of the location, according to Director of Geo Accuracy Engineering Limited Watson Mwakalila said. Speaking to reporters at the weekend, he said the government had done a good job by decentralising the issuance of title deeds to regional and zonal levels instead of the headquarters as it was the case before. He said time was up for the Ministry of Lands and Human Settlements Development to come up with the online application system that would be a platform for application, submission and approval of all land documents and the issuance of title deeds. Mr Mwakalila also called for review of the Land Surveyors Act so that they could be categorised as it was the case with other areas. He said the government should have a database of scanned documents so that in case of conflict they could be just retrieved for amicable land conflict resolution. Mr Mwakalila said the government should implement a public awareness programme for members of the public to understand the importance of acquiring title deeds. He said the response was very low despite the fact that the government had decided to reduce surveying fees, but only a limited number of people understood the importance and took proper measures. “They miss a number of opportunities like loan facilities just because they do not have title deeds. Public awareness in needed as a certificate is of great importance in a number of areas,” he insisted.
