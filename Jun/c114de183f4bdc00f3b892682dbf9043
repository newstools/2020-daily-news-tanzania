Egypt witnessed on Friday a record of 1,577 single-day new COVID-19 cases, raising the total infections confirmed in the country since mid-February to 41,303, said spokesman with the Health Ministry. Egypt also confirmed 45 new coronavirus-related deaths, taking the death toll from the disease to 1,422, said Khaled Megahed, the health ministry’s spokesman, in a statement. Meanwhile, Megahed noted that 417 patients have recovered and left hospitals in the past 24 hours, bringing the total recoveries to 11,108. The spokesman reiterated that all COVID-19 cases in Egypt receive necessary medical care “in accordance with the guidelines of the World Health Organization.” Since March 25, the Egyptian government has been imposing a nighttime curfew as a key precautionary measure in combating the deadly virus. On Thursday, the government announced it will reduce the current nine-hour curfew to eight hours from June 14 to 30, amid a “coexistence plan” to maintain anti-coronavirus precautionary measures while resuming economic activities. The country will also resume foreign tourism and aviation services in some coastal provinces with the least COVID-19 infections starting July 1, after they have been suspended since March 19 over coronavirus concerns. The most populous Arab country has already started gradual reopening of services and offices, and allowed operation of over 200 hotels for local tourists with 50-percent capacity after they were given official hygiene safety certificates.
