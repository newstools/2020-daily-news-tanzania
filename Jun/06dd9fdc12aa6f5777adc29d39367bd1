SIMBA Sports Club skipper, John Bocco has expressed how determined is his squad to win the Mainland Premier League title after revealing that, they will safely secure 6 more points in Mbeya, against Mbeya City and Tanzania Prisons. Bocco made his remarks as the squad of 26 players left for Mbeya, yesterday. He also added that all of his squad members are healthy and fit to face the opponents. Simba will play against Mbeya City on Wednesday, June 24th  and then lock horns Tanzania Prisons in July 1st, both games to be staged at Sokoine Stadium. “All our players are in a good shape and our goal is to collect six points from the both games we are going to play in Mbeya.” “We know that both games will be difficult as each team needs three points, but we are prepared to face our opponents and we shall do whatever it takes to secure victory in both games.” Simba are currently placed on the top of the ladder with 75 points from 30 matches and they just need to win three more matches to be crowned the Mainland Premier League title for the third consecutive time. Thus, if Simba win both games at Sokoine Stadium, they will need another win to widen their gap against their closest challengers Azam Football Club who have pocketed 58 points and Young Africans who parade 56 points.  Namungo FC who have penned 54 points, are not far from the leaders.
