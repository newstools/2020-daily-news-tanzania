HISTORY has been written in Tanzania as the first passenger plane landed at Abeid Amani Karume International Airport in Zanzibar at 1650 hrs (local time) packed fully with tourists. This came after the government opened the country’s skies after realising that majority of the Covid-19 patients locally were recovering and no more new cases being registered. The visitors from different nationalities aboard Ethiopian Airlines were then received by the Minister of Natural Resources and Tourism, Dr Hamisi Kigwangalla and Deputy Minister responsible for Health, Community Development, Gender, Elderly and Children Dr Godwin Mollel at Kilimanjaro International Airport (KIA) with claps and enthusiasm as they lighted from the plane. Welcoming them, Dr Kigwangalla said it was a historic day as tourism season starts, adding that by mid-June more and more will be coming in. "This is a historic day…we see light of hope as tourists start jetting in the country. In mid-June we will have more and more and by July it will be peak," pointed out the Minister. Some major airlines like The Emirates, KLM, Turkish Airlines and Qatar are set to resume trips to Tanzania this month and July after the UN World Tourist Organisation (UNWTO) issued a statement that the situation is expected to return to normalcy. In a related development, Dr Kigwangalla pointed out that hotels are once again fully booked this month, hinting that business will resume in large scale. He urged the public especially the locals to show cooperation to the tourists, wherever they would be especially at Serengeti and Ngorongoro tourists’ attraction sites.
