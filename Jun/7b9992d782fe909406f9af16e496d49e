TANZANIA Golf Union (TGU) has revised this year’s calendar of events after being deeply disrupted by the coronavirus crisis. According to the union’s competition secretary, Enock Magile that they have decided to revise calendar for remaining tournaments which will be staged after the government allows sports activities to resume countrywide. According to the new calendar, Morogoro Open Championship is scheduled to re-open the golf fixture in mid next month. The tournament, according to TGU, will be staged at the Morogoro Gymkhana Club course in Morogoro on July 18th and 19th this year. The tournament was earlier planned to tee off on June 27th and 28th this year at the same course. However, according to Magile, TGU is still waiting for the hosting club to confirm the new dates before allowing golfers to prepare for the two-day event. He said that the 36-hole stroke play competition is open for all golfers; men, ladies and junior players. Speaking from Morogoro, one of the club’s officials Anita Siwale confirmed that club is yet to confirm the new dates. “Yes I understand that we are due to host Morogoro Open in near future, but we are waiting for other formalities before making official confirmation,” she said. Siwale said that everyone looking forward to enter into competition once again, while an effort is in place to insure facilities are safe for golfers. The tournament will bring together top men’s and ladies golfers from different clubs in the country, which are Tanzania People’s Defense Forces (TPDF), Lugalo Golf Club, Dar es Salaam Gymkhana Club (DGC) of Dar es Salaam, Arusha Gymkhana (AGC), and Kili Golf of Arusha, TPC Moshi, Moshi Gymkhana Club and Mufindi Club of Iringa.
