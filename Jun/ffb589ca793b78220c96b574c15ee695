In its resolution, the Security Council also welcomed the arrest in France on May 16, 2020 of FÃ©licien Kabuga, indicted on genocide and crimes against humanity allegedly committed in Rwanda in 1994. It commended the Mechanism Office of the Prosecutor for its cooperation with law enforcement and the judicial authorities in France, as well as Rwanda, Belgium, the United Kingdom, Germany, Austria, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, the United States, Switzerland and others, together with EUROPOL and INTERPOL, which contributed to locating and to the arrest of the fugitive.

On February 29, 2016, he was appointed by the United Nations Security Council to serve as Prosecutor of the Mechanism. On June 26, 2020, he was reappointed to a new term, with effect from July 1, 2020 until June 30, 2022. Dr Brammertz previously served as Prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia from January 1, 2008 until its closure at the end of 2017.
