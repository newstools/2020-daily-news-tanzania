BENJAMIN Mkapa Hospital (BMH) Executive Director, Dr Alphonce Chandika, has called on new doctors to adhere to professionalism and the public service code of conduct to maintain a good image of the hospital. Addressing new doctors during an induction workshop at the hospital recently, Dr Chandika said BMH offered patient-centred care and so it should be maintained. “We are a client-centred hospital…it is the client who hired us. For us, a client is number one. Responding to a client badly is criminal (offence) here,” he said while opening a workshop for 20 newly employed doctors. The new medics are among 1,000 doctors who have been employed following President John Magufuli’s promise during a meeting with medical doctors in Dar es Salaam City early this year. Dr Chandika explained that being a public servant meant that a medic was hired by members of the public and that they should serve patients with great respect. “Make sure you avoid taking a bribe from a patient. Do not imitate a bad culture or habit while discharging your duties,” he noted. Dr Chandika further urged the new doctors to work diligently while complying with public service core values. “We are the servants of people and we should comply with BMH’s motto of putting on the client’s shoes, accountability and commitment,” he said. For her part, BMH Director of Nursing Services Salome Kassanga urged the new doctors to discharge their duties while observing customer care, noting it was key to maintaining a good image of BMH. “If we had no good customer care we would have chased away customers. Customer care is vital while discharging out duties,” she said. In March this year, BMH performed its 12th kidney transplant and the first kidney transplant using local doctors becoming the first hospital in the country to perform such a surgery without the support of overseas doctors
