YOUNG players aspiring to be soccer stars in Dodoma can now have their dreams realized, having been taken aboard the special training programme at the Fountain Gate Academy. Officially started yesterday on June 11th, the football training school has drawn 30 youth aged between 15 and 20 years who will later form quality teams for the future Under-17 and Under-20 sides. “We are dealing with older children because those aged Under-15 are still susceptible to contacting infections as the country continues to play safe against Covid-19 pandemic,” said the Director of Fountain Gate Academy, Japhet Makau. According to Makau, the soccer training programme will run for three consecutive months, targeting youth who are not in schools, including those who have completed studies. The Fountain Gate Foundation operates schools and special academies in Dodoma and Dar es Salaam regions. As for the sports academy, which is now in a second year, there are 120 youthful trainees aged between 6 and 20 years. In October, the Fountain Gate will prepare the youth football tournament for Private Schools also to be held in Dodoma city. Later in December, the Fountain Gate will also organise the Under-13 and Under-20 football tournaments at the same venue. Already the Fountain Gate has produced many quality young soccer players who have now qualified to play in the well-established events such like the Second Division League. The Fountain Gate Football Club is now bracing to play in the top-six. The FG team played against JKT Tanzania recently and lost 2-0; however it was a friendly match staged as the preparation for the resumption of the Second Division League (SDL) which is about to start later this month.
