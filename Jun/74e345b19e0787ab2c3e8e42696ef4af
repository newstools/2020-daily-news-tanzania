THE Government Procurement Services Agency (GPSA) has expressed its commitment to supporting the education sector to address challenges facing it. The commitment was given at the weekend by GPSA Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Prof Geraldine Rasheli, during the handover of 100 desks to address a shortage in Kongwa District. He handed over the desks to Kongwa MP and Speaker of the National Assembly Job Ndugai during an event held at the district council. “This is just corporate social responsibility commitment and the education sector has been our priority area and we will keep on supporting it,” he said. He noted that the government had been doing a wonderful job to improve the education sector and join hands to ensure there was a conducive learning and teaching environment. Earlier, Speaker Ndugai said the district council was having a shortage of 15,000 desks which was to the detriment of students and to their education career. He thanked GPSA for the support that would address the desks challenge in number of schools in the district and improve the learning and teaching environment, including academic performance. Speaker Ndugai called upon Kongwa District Council to ensure the desks were distributed to schools which were in dire need. He insisted that when distributing the desks, the council must stress a need to take good care of them so that they could last for a long time.
