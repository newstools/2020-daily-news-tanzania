WHILE the National Electoral Commission (NEC), starts a four-day display of voters’ register here, its counterpart, Zanzibar Electoral Commission (ZEC), has ended the second and last round of its voters’ register update. According to a press statement from ZEC, its main agent here, all voters who registered with NEC have to check their names and details in the voters’ register to be displayed in all selected areas where they registered. “Check your details, and it is time to appeal against anybody whom you think is not an eligible voter,” the statement reads as the ZEC Director, Mr Thabit Idarous Faina announced that the end of ZEC’s voters’ register updating will be followed by similar display. He thanked political parties in the country and other stakeholders for showing full cooperation during the second phase of updating the voter’s register which started in Pemba Island and ended in Unguja Island last Friday. “We need to maintain good relations as we continue with preparations for the general elections later this year. Many eligible citizens turned-up to register. However, a considerable number of people missed registration due to lack of mandatory Zanzibar resident Identification card (ZanID). According to ZEC, more than 400,000 voters registered during the first phase, and the number is expected to increase after adding those who registered in the second phase. Only people with Zanzibar’s Resident Identity Card (ZanID) will be registered. Both President John Magufuli and his Zanzibar counterpart Dr Ali Mohamed Shein have promised that peaceful general elections will be held as planned.
