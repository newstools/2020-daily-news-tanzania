THE Board Chairperson of National Environmental Management Council (NEMC), Prof Esnat Chaggu, has directed the management to research on the reasons behind an increase in the level of Lake Victoria water. Prof Chaggu told the NEMC management to come up with suggestions on the causes and a workable solution to the problem. She was speaking to journalists in Kagera Region during the board members’ tour to inspect the damage caused by floods and the effects of the rising water level in the lake. “NEMC is in a good position to research and give a solution to this problem. You must find previous researches and get some recommendations, which, I believe will lead us to a successful study,” said Prof Chaggu. He said collaboration was needed to ensure the study was a success and the findings would shed light on the rising water level. “As the lake also covers Kenya and Uganda it is essential for the authorities to work together and come up with a common approach on how to deal with the situation,” he insisted. He said Lake Victoria benefits were immense for the countries sharing it, thus there was a need to protect it for the current and future generations. For his part, NEMC Deputy Board Chairman, Prof Hussein Sosovele, said in tackling environmental effects it was advisable that the residents observed indicative directives from NEMC to avoid unnecessary losses. According to an assessment conducted by the Lake Victoria Basin Commission (LVBC), whose results were released in May, this year, the water volume in Africa’s largest fresh water lake increased marginally compared to 13.41 metres recorded on May 5, 1964.
