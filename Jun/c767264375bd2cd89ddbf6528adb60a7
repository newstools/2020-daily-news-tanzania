VIGNAN Institute of Science and Technology (VIST), has commended the government for the massive investment in the health sector, promising to produce competent clinical officers to supplement the efforts. The Director of the institute, Naidu Katuri told this paper that since there is great shortage of healthcare professionals, especially clinical officers, his newly established institute will do its best to fill the gap. He said his institute will produce large number of clinical officers who primarily serve in the rural areas of Tanzania where majority of people live. He further said that the institute which is located in Mbezi Beach area opposite Interchick Factory on the New Bagamoyo Road will do its best in order to achieve the Tanzania Vision 2025, National Strategy for Economic Growth and Poverty Reduction. He stated that VIST will use its experienced teachers and state of the art teaching facilities appropriately to prepare competent clinical officers who will be deployed all over Tanzania for achieving equity-oriented national health goals. “We have accreditation from the National Council for Technical Education (NACTE),  so we welcome applications from eligible candidates who wish to pursue studies leading to Ordinary Diploma in Clinical Medicine (NTA Level 4-6) and Certificate in Clinical medicine (NTA Level 4-5) for the academic year 2020-21,” he said. “Applicants should have a minimum of four passes at “D” level in Chemistry, Biology, Physics, and one other non-religious subject at Certificate of Secondary Education Examination (CSEE), level,” he said. He said the institute also plans to expand the offer of other programs by next academic year in the fields of health sciences and technology, including pharmacy, nursing, lab technology, and information systems. “We plan to admit 150 Diploma in Clinical Medicine students this year and expect to have about 1,000 students by the next academic year in all the programs it expects to be offered,” he said He added that parents and guardians are encouraged to send their children to VIST for quality education and training, saying that interested candidates are invited to obtain application forms from the VIST campus or at the websitewww.vist.ac.tz.
