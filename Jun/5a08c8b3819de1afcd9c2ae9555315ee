RUKWA Regional Commissioner (RC) Joachim Wangabo has directed Regional Administrative Secretary (RAS) Bernard Makali to communicate with higher authorities mandated to take to task Nkasi District Council Executive Director (DED) Missana Kwangura. Mr Wangabo said he was prompted to issue such a directive due to the laxity of DED to lead the council to receive a qualified opinion on the 2018/19 fiscal year from the Controller and Auditor General (CAG). The RC issued the directive during a full council meeting held in Namanyere Town where councillors received and discussed the opinions of CAG of which the Nkasi District Council got a qualified opinion of the 2018/19 fiscal year. Equally, the RC gave the DED seven days to take to task all civil servants who had caused the council to receive a qualified opinion report. “All those who have caused the council to receive the qualified opinion must be punished. I give you (DED) seven days to furnish me with a written report on how you have disciplined them.” Because this council has no mandate to discipline their DED so I’m directing RAS to communicate with higher authorities mandated to discipline the DED. The RC further explained that for the council to receive the qualified opinion the council had been disqualified to receive funds for the implementation of major strategic projects for three years consecutively. “This is the worse and severe punishment for the council which has been disqualified to receive funds for major strategic plans for three years ...this is a big blow caused by few civil servants,” he added. For his part, Nkasi District Council Chairman Sumuni Mwanakulya said for the council to get a qualified opinion from CAG was a wake-up call for officials to pull up their socks and get a clean opinion next time.
