THE Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Natural Resources and Tourism, Prof Adolf Mkenda, has suspended four senior officials , including Director of Tourism, Deogratius Mdamu, to pave the way for investigations over financial irregularities. The measures were taken a day after the Ministry of Finance and Planning conducted a special investigation into the Tanzania Tourism Development Levy (TDL) and identified some fraud. According to a statement released to the media on Wednesday by the ministry’s Spokesperson, Dorina Makaya, others who have been suspended include Internal Auditor Flora Masami and the former ministry’s accountant, Moses Msemo who is currently working with Tanapa. The PS also asked the Director-General of the Prevention and Combating of Corruption Bureau (PCCB) to investigate former TDL Accountant, Eliud Kijalo and other officials involved in the allegations. Kijalo has already been arrested to assist in the investigations. “The Ministry of Natural Resources and Tourism will cooperate with PCCB so that appropriate measures can be taken as quickly as possible,” said Makaya. PCCB is holding Kijalo, the official from the Ministry of Natural Resources and Tourism, who is alleged to have embezzled over 4bn/-. On Wednesday, PCCB stated that they are holding four senior officials of the National Environment Management Council (NEMC) and one officer of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Tourism over various corruption allegations.
