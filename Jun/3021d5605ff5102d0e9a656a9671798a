BUGANDO Medical Centre (BMC) has launched a factory for manufacturing personal protective equipment (PPE) on its premises to curb the spread of coronavirus (Covid- 19). Speaking during the launch recently, BMC Acting Director Fabian Massaga said they looked forward to improving health services by ensuring all requisite equipment was available for providing services. He said the launch of the factory was part of BMC efforts to ensure quality and reliable health services. “PPE will be used by medical staff attending to patients. The PPE is crucial especially at this time when the world is battling Covid- 19,” he noted. He added that the hospital supported the government on the war against the novel virus and that so far the country had registered roaring success in the war. Dr Massaga explained that the manufacturing of PPE at the hospital would help save billions of shillings being spent by the government for purchasing the protective gear from abroad. He added that the hospital was also working hard to expand the oxygen factory as directed by President John Magufuli when he visited the facility. “We are producing handwashing sanitisers and we are capable of producing 1,000 litres of sanitisers per day. We also produce facemasks,” he said. Mwanza Regional Commissioner (RC) John Mongella commended the hospital management, saying such a move would cut down costs and help save the lives of many Tanzanians.
