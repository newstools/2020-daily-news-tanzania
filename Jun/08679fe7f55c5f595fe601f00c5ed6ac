PERMANENT Secretary in the Prime Minister’s Office (Labour, Youth and Employment), Andrew Massawe, has directed the Occupational Safety and Health Authority (OSHA) to speedily address challenges facing its stakeholders in attempts to improve workplace for national development. Mr Massawe also said there was a need to increase public education on safety issues at workplaces and reinforcing law in order to reduce accidents and diseases. The PS issued the directive over the weekend, while visiting OSHA office to make follow up of his last January directive that they introduce Workplace Information Management System (WIMS) at workplaces. The system aims at managing safety and health inspection records, and improves service delivery to customers and revenue collections. During his meeting with the management of OSHA, he had opportunity to hear from authority’s Acting Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Khadija Mwenda, who informed him that the system also enables employers to register their workplaces and employees through online portal and pay all sorts of bills. It also entails booking training, requesting routine inspections, reporting accidents, viewing compliance status, and updating workplace details as well as enabling authority’s access to a number of reports. Explaining, he directed the authority to start using the government system and reinforce a sustainable education programme for it to educate the public on its importance and improve the authority’s website. However, Mr Massawe noted that he was satisfied with their progress, saying that OSHA, which is an institution under the ministry has mandate to enforce law guiding safety and health at workplaces.
