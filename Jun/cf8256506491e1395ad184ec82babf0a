KAGERA Regional Secretary of The Tanzania Federation of Disabled People’s Organisations (SHIVYAWATA), Sweetbert Mshanga, has appealed to parents with children with disabilities, including people with albinism, not to hide them because they have the potential to perform well in future life if they get the right assistance at an early stage. Mr Mshanga, who is also a disabled person, told the “Sunday News” that being disabled does not automatically make a person a dependent. “Parents should avoid hiding children with disabilities, including those with albinism. They have potential to develop and become future government workers and leaders,” he said. He advised parents to ensure that such children get equal education like other children. He also called upon public and private institutions to ensure that buildings were fitted with friendly infrastructure for people with disabilities. “Most public buildings, including schools, libraries and offices lack infrastructure friendly to people with special needs. This negatively affected them as they are limited to offer maximum service,” he said. He noted that the members were engaged in different activities, including entrepreneurship, poultry and vegetable production. The Tanzania Federation of Disabled People’s Organisations (SHIVYAWATA), is a mouthpiece for matters pertaining to people with disabilities. Established in 1992, it brings together national organisations, namely Tanzania Albino Society (TAS), Tanzania League of the Blind (TLB) and Tanzania Association of the Physically Handicap (CHAWATA). Others are Tanzania Association of the Deaf (CHAVITA), Tanzania Association of the Deaf – Blind (TASODEB), Tanzania Association for the Mentally Handicap, Tanzania Users and Survivors of Psychiatric Organisation (TUSPO) and Association of Spinal Bifida and Hydrocephalous of Tanzania (ASBAHT).
