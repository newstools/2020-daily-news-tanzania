Kishapu District Council has received about 1,200 tonnes of high breed cotton seeds for this coming farming season, it has been revealed. Council Agricultural Officer Kessy George said before the distribution of the seeds to growers they would conduct special training on how to apply modern farming methods. "Among other things sessions of public education will encourage them to remove all cotton residues of traditional seeds, mostly stumps that have been left in fields to serve as seeds for the next farming season," said the agricultural officer. Agricultural experts will provide education on a modern cotton farming methodology, including plant spacing and farm input application for high crop yield. Bunambiyu Ward Agriculture Officer Ramadhani Gikufa confirmed to have received 49 tonnes of modern cotton seeds from the council, ready to be supplied to 1,530 farmers in his area after public education sessions were over. He admitted that some farmers had been leaving cotton stumps, as seedlings for the next farming season hence, public education was of most importance. "The problem is that some have not been attending public education despite its importance for their personal and national development. However, we won't get tired of encouraging them," he said. When reached for comments, a cotton grower from Bunambiyu Village commended the council' step on the availability of high breed cotton seeds, saying for many years farmers had been earning almost nothing. He admitted that farmers usually had no assurance of the availability of new seeds for the following farming season. The villager said they would switch to new farming technology because what they sought for was high quality crop yield. "I have been farming cotton for a couple of years, but what I earn is quite different from what I invest. The coming of these modern seeds will change our livelihoods and encourage us to engage in cotton growing," he commented.
