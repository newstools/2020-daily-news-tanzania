I&M Bank has embarked on a corporate and social responsibility initiative that will enable the bank staff to transfer knowledge on entrepreneurial skills, financial management and personal savings. I&M Bank Marketing and Communications Manager Anitha Pallangyo said the aim of the programme was to ensure I&M Bank and its staff supported the community through knowledge transfer. “I&M Bank Tanzania understands community needs. That’s why we have come up with this initiative that will have maximum impact on society as a whole,” she said. The one for one programme dubbed ‘IM FOR YOU’ is intended to address the rate of unemployment that faces most of Tanzanian graduates. Learning & Development Manager Juliana Mtei and other staff from various departments conducted training on financial management, entrepreneurship skills, cooking skills and first aid to support the community and improve business skills and self-employment through entrepreneurial skills provided. “The programme is a one for one initiative that aims at utilising the internal taskforce that’s I&M resources, who we believe own various exciting artistic and technical skills that can help bring about change in society,” she said. She said besides the skills that they had planned to offer to the Yombo community, the staff of I&M had also donated clothes, shoes and other materials to support women taking care of handicapped children, orphans and widows in a group. I&M Bank offers various services to cater for the needs of the whole community starting from a junior through a young savers account, the youth, business entrepreneurs from micro, medium and small as well as women through the ‘I&M Tunaweza Women’s Account’. "We commend the spirit of women for striking the perfect balance between managing work and family. We believe that it is our responsibility as an organisation to make opportunities available for women to invest and improve their businesses."
