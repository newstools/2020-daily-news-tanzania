THE police in Mwanza are hunting for Mr Adam Athuman, aged between 30 and 40 years, over allegedly killing his 10-year-old son, Athuman Adam. The incident occurred on November 22, 2020 at about 11:30pm in Buswelu Ward, wherein the father caned his biological son with sticks on various parts of his body, causing his death. “The son was a Standard Three pupil at Nyamadoke Primary School in Buswelu Ward. The alleged killer ran away after the incident. The police are yet to establish the motive behind the father’s action. Until now we haven’t established what prompted the father to act inhumanely,” said Regional Police Commander (RPC) Muliro Jumanne. The police regional boss insisted that law enforcers would ensure the man was prosecuted. The RPC warned parents of punishing harshly their children, saying they were committing criminal offences that would land them in court.
