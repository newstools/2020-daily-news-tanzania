THE price of cement remained high for the second month even as manufacturers refuted reports of public complaints against the commodity’s inflated prices. A spot survey across retailers and dealers in Dodoma on Sunday revealed a mixture of the product being scarce in most retail stores but available to selected dealers, yet at a painful price to consumers. A bag of cement was available at a retail price of between 19,000/- and 24,000/- depending on the brand. Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Trade and Industries Prof. Riziki Shemdoe said the country has enough cement for the local market. He said the government was concerned with reports of cement shortage and wanted to keep the supply high. “There is a high demand for cement in the country considering the ongoing strategic projects. I expect industries will keep up to their production pace to cover the demand,” he said when he visited and held talks with cement manufacturers in Tanga. At the Jamuhuri Stadium here, dealers said they had no cement while others had trucks offloading the commodity in their warehouses. A customer identified as Mama Aisha said that she had moved from store to store and only to get cement at an inflated price. “The last time I bought cement this year was just 15,000/- per 50kg bag but today I had to part with 23,000/-. “It’s hurting if you have an ongoing project,” she said. Dodoma, lacking cement plants, heavily depends on other regions with cement factories. The Dangote cement plant in Mtwara last week resumed mass production after weeks of suspension. On the other hand, Simba Cement complained of power cuts and proposed that it should be connected to the natural gas pipeline to ensure constant production.
