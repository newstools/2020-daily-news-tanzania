YARA Tanzania has launched a new product dubbed ‘Mi- CROP’ in Kilimanjaro Region to help maize and rice smallholders increase production. Speaking during the launch of the new product in Moshi on Tuesday, which was witnessed by government officials, farmers, distributors and the media, Yara Tanzania Commercial Manager Philipo Mwakipesile described the product as a panacea for small growers to get more yields. Mr Mwakipesile said the new blended fertiliser had zinc and sulphur micronutrients that were required for better crops. “We are proud of launching MiCROP fertiliser in Kilimanjaro Region where maize and rice smallholder farmers will have an opportunity to get more yields and improve their incomes,” he said. According to Mr Mwakipesile, the fertiliser will be blended locally at a Yara plant in Dar es Salaam. “This is in line with the government’s initiative to promote and build an industrial economy by 2025,” he said. He called on farmers to utilise MiCROP for better yields, adding that it would be distributed countrywide. During the event, the Yara Tanzania team handed over the fertiliser to their distributors and showcased a sample of products. Earlier, Senior Irrigation Engineer at Kilimanjaro Regional Office, Mr Salvatory Matemu, on behalf of Moshi RAO welcomed the product launch, saying it was timely following a request from farmers who wanted the firm to bring the product close to them. “We really appreciate the services rendered by Yara Tanzania especially in our region. I am optimistic that MiCROP will boost crop production,” Mr Matemu explained.
