THE Tanzania Premier League Board (TPLB) has repeated that this season’s Mainland Premier League campaign is tense to all competing teams which make up the family of 18 contestants. This was a feedback from the board’s Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Almas Kasongo after witnessing the first stand up traditional derby fixture of the season (Young Africans v Simba) which elapsed 1-1 at Benjamin Mkapa Stadium in the city on Saturday. “For us league runners, we are pleased to watch one of the great derby matches between the two teams which was open to either side as Yanga had a good first half while Simba enjoyed the second half. “So far, what I have observed is that we are heading towards having one of the best league season than ever before and this can be seen from the level of competition currently underway in the league,” Kasongo said. He further pointed out that aside from Simba and Yanga dominance in the contest, also other teams are working hard to ensure that they collect crucial points from their respective games. However, TPLB, through its club licensing regulations has been on the front pedal to entice football clubs to upgrade all their league hosting venues or else face suspension from staging competitive matches. The drive has seen the board banning a number of stadiums whose playing pitches leaves a lot to be desired forcing the concerned teams to upgrade such arenas. Football followers across the country hailed the move saying it is a good step to reach a promised land where the beautiful game would be played at conducive environment befitting the top class league. Gwambina Complex which is a home turf to Gwambina FC is a good example of the venue which was once suspended from hosting league matches due to unfit pitch but now, after upgrading it, the venue has become one of the best in the country
