THE long standing peace and security in the country will be among the key issues the government will ensure prevails through stable management. President John Magufuli said this while inaugurating the 12th Parliament in Dodoma on Friday, saying that the government will work closely with national and international security organs, including those from Southern African Development Community (SADC) and East African Community (EAC) in promoting and maintaining peace and security. “Our top priority in the next five years is to continue maintaining the national values that include peace and stability in the country,” he said. Dr Magufuli said that the country’s security is stable and working with high integrity in addressing peace and security issues in the country. He cited the example of how the national intelligence and security agency exercised steadiness in maintaining peace and stability during and after the October 28th, 2020 General Election. “I highly thank the country's security organs for commendable supervision of peace, security and stability in the country and borders throughout the election time...this is a clear testimony that our security organs are very stable in maintaining peace and security in the country,” he said. He said the just ended national election has proved to the world that Tanzanians are very peaceful and that they cannot be deceived in distracting the country's long standing peace and stability. Ruling CCM 2020 manifesto states that his government will continue scaling up actions in preventing insecurity forces in the country’s borders to promote peace and stability for Tanzania's people both in the Isles and Tanzania mainland. The ruling party's next five-year manifesto points to the need for enabling close collaboration of security agencies and research institutions, creating new security techniques, improving the security and protection from the community to national level, to be able to identify suspicious threats.
