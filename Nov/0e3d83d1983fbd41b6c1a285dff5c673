Standard Four being the last to wind up the year’s national examination are scheduled to sit for Standard Four National Assessment (SFNA) from the 25th to 26th of this month with 17,812 pupils being tested. However, Dr Msonde has directed regional and district examination committees as well as invigilators to ensure that there is an enabling environment for the exercise to be conducted smoothly at all the centres. “The committees ought to ensure there is adequate security to curb cheating or any form of malpractice,” he instructed. Dr Msonde further clarified that candidates with special needs would be given additional 20 minutes in Mathematics tests and 10 more minutes in other subjects as per Necta regulations. However, he warned owners of private examination centres to avoid meddling in the exams, stressing that Necta would not hesitate to revoke their licences if any would be found to have violated Necta guidelines. He said they should take the exams as important in assessing the proficiency of students during their periods in schools as they prepare to join a higher level of education. “Results from these examinations help identify areas that are lagging behind and need to be focused on for improvements,” he stressed.
