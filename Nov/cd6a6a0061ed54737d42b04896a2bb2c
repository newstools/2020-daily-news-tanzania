US President Donald Trump's spiritual adviser Paula White-Cain says "angels have been released" from Africa and South America to help him win. During a fervent prayer service, she says: "I hear a sound of victory. The Lord says it is done. For I hear, victory, victory, victory in the quarters of heaven." The pastor adds that "angels have been despatched" from Africa and South America. "They're coming here in the name of Jesus... angelic reinforcements," she says, in a highly animated performance that also saw her take aim at "demonic confederacies that are attempting to steal the election from Trump". The clips have spread widely on social media - perhaps fuelled by the millions of people waiting to hear more news from states where the vote count is still on going.
