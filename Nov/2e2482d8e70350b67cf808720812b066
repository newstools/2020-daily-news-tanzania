FORMER Mali's president, Amadou Toumani Toure has died in Turkey aged 72; a family member and a doctor have been quoted by Aljazeera early on Tuesday. Toure steered the Sahel nation to democracy and led it for a decade before being ousted in a coup. “He died during the night of Monday to Tuesday in Turkey," where he had been taken for health reasons,” his nephew Oumar Toure told AFP. A doctor in Bamako said the former leader had recently undergone heart surgery in the city's Luxembourg Hospital.
