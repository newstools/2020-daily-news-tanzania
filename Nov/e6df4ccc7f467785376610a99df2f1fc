Russian President Vladimir Putin has said, he is ready to work with any U.S. leader, but he is not ready to recognize the election victory of Joe Biden. "We will work with anyone who has the confidence of the American peopleâ€¦.."But that confidence can only be given to a candidate whose victory has been recognized by the opposing party, or after the results are confirmed in a legitimate, legal way." Said Putin on Russian state TV Sunday. The comments are some of the most detailed since the election from Putin, one of a dwindling number of leaders who haven't recognized Biden as the next U.S. head of state. Russia, accused by U.S. intelligence agencies of intervening in 2016 to help get Trump elected, has been wary of Biden, fearing an increase in sanctions pressure and clashes over human rights.
