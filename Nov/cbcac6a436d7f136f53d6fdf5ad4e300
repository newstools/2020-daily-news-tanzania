During the quarter, the group after-tax profit jumped 31 per cent to 120bn/- compared to 92bn/- reported in the same quarter last year. CRDB Group CEO and Managing Director Abdulmajid Nsekela attributed the sustained positive growth to proactive strategies that have steered the lender in the wake of an unprecedented pandemic that has adversely impacted various sectors of the economy. “We have not relented in our quest to pursue economic transformation because we know that despite challenges in the market, our resilience is what will make a difference,” Mr Nsekela said. Twiga also reported a 33- per cent year-on-year increase in net profit to 34.94bn/- in the first half of this year against 26.19bn/- in the previous half. “Despite strong competition in the cement manufacturing industry and uncertainties brought about by Covid-19, [we] delivered a strong operational result compared to [last year],” said Hakan Gurdal, Twiga Chairman. The company also saw a 13-per cent rise in revenue to 181.45bn/-. “[We are] well-positioned to meet this growing demand and will continue working to maintain [our] market leadership and position,” Mr Gurdal said. Orbit Securities Head of Research and Analytics Imani Muhingo said CRDB Bank was trading less than 50 per cent of its book value to attract more investors. “CRDB Bank is much undervalued while NMB Bank is overvalued,” Mr Muhingo said adding: “Although book value per share isn’t a good gauge for banks of their balance sheet setup it still gives a good indication.” The economist said the price of CRDB Bank was flexible, while NMB Bank had remained “stagnant for almost two years now”.
