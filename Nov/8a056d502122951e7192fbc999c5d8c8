MWANZA Regional Commissioner (RC), Mr John Mongella, on Tuesday launched fundraising special boxes whose targeted funds will be used for children with autism complications. The boxes will be distributed in various private and public offices, targeting to collect at least 600m/- that will be allocated in construction of the Autism Centre in the region. Such donation technique was organised by a non-governmental organisation, “Living Together Autism Foundation,” (Li-TAFO). Reading the speech on behalf of the RC, Nyamagana District Commissioner (DC), Dr. Phylis Nyimbi commented that the government was aware of the challenges facing autism victims, including lack of special facilities to offer them various social services. He called for more stakeholders to back up Li-TAFO efforts in supporting the government on provision of social and other services to children with autism. The DC further insisted on parents and members of the public to communicate with health service providers once they observe any autism symptoms in children. Li-TAFO Director, Engineer Shangwe Mgaya said if the fundraising exercise goes as planned, then installation of the Centre will take place early in the first months of next year. According to her, the Centre will be composed of among others, recreational units for socialisation purposes. She stressed that the NGO was facing various challenges, including financial constraints for recruiting enough human resources to serve the autism victims.
