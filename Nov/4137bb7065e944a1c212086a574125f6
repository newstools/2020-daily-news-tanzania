I STILL remember the first evening when I was in Marangu, it is not because of hundreds of streams which flow from the tropical rainforest of Mount Kilimanjaro or mountainous terrain which dominate the area, it is the glowing cloud which flashed from a nearby bush and sent on my foot while begging for my life, to my surprise one of friend laughed at me. Those were the days when Marangu and other areas around Mount Kilimanjaro was dominated by huge trees which blocked the moonlight to reach where we were crossing Moonjo river. That evening ran away because of fear as my friend talked about leopard which were believed to hide on the caves found on the banks of the river, my friends told me those were fireflies flying from one bush to another searching for food, the firefly is a small beautiful but terrifying insect which dwells in the bushes of tropical forest. Meanwhile last week we saw how flower enabled the evolution of seed into the savannah, that was not possible without the presences of insects. The firefly is found in the order of coleoptera which between 40,000 and 360,000 species play an important role to control the populations of many insects by feeding on caterpillars and other immature insects, scientists say all their common ancestor evolved between 270 and 220 million years ago, that was a time when the planet Earth witnessed dramatic geological, climatic, and evolutionary change which allowed life to evolve in the ocean but eventually transitioned onto land as many great forests of primitive plants covered the continents. The drama started between 300 and 250 million years ago when an ancient super continent went through topography transformation which resulted into breaking up about 175 million years ago, at that time climate was probably moderate at first, becoming warmer over the course of time as both oxygen and carbon dioxide had recovered to more normal levels but due to different climatic changes there was a decreasing of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere which  caused a rapid cooling of big water bodies in the northern hemisphere  and allowed formation of glaciers on different part of the region including mountains. It was between 210 and 145 million years ago when ancestors of these species undergo a dramatic change which enabled evolution of members who are predators and herbivorous, meanwhile time after time the diversity of the early plant-eating species increased as plant-eating insects feed on flowering plants or angiosperms, whose success contributed to a doubling of plant-eating species. Scientists say fireflies are found in the phylum of arthropods which is estimated to have species vary between 1,170,000 and 5 to 10 million and account for over 80% of all known living animal species. The firefly is well known for it is unique ability to use biological mechanism which is capable to produce light, on their side scientists say this is what is called bioluminescence which is the production and emission of light by a living organism which occurs widely in different groups of marine vertebrates and invertebrates, as well as in some fungi, microorganisms including some terrestrial arthropods such as fireflies. Scientists say in some animals the light is bacteriogenic while in others, it is autogenic, produced by the animals themselves, and in a general sense, the principal chemical reaction in bioluminescence involves a light-emitting molecule and an enzyme, generally called luciferin and luciferase, respectively. Since these are generic names, these insects are often distinguished by including the species or group example firefly, in all characterized cases, the enzyme catalyzes the oxidation of the luciferin, scientists say bioluminescence is a unique process where light energy is released by a chemical reaction and this reaction involves a light-emitting pigment which use the luciferin, a luciferase and the enzyme component. Scientists describe luciferin as a generic term for the light emitting compound found in organisms that generate bioluminescence, luciferins typically undergo an enzyme-catalyzed reaction with molecular oxygen, this is a  result of transformation process which usually involves splitting off a molecular fragment, produces an excited state intermediate that emits light upon decaying to its ground state, however, unlike fluorescent proteins, luciferases do not require an external light source, but do require addition of luciferin, the consumable substrate. On the side of fireflies, the action is romantic and very lovely because it is used as candle light, fireflies use light to attract mates and in this ritualized romantic act two systems are involved according to species; in one, females emit light from their abdomens to attract males; in the other, flying males emit signals to which the sometimes inactive females respond. A firefly may generate light for different usage but while going out for a romantic scene an individual may produce light to defend itself against predators who may smell and catch it in midair, scientists say out of 2000 species some are very smart that its only male or females who produce light and to differentiate themselves from other each specie have its own rhythm of producing light in different colour. Using coded format of beats, a male firefly may fly from one bush to another while sending romantic calls to his lovely partner who may be in a nearby bush waiting for a suitor, when the female is convinced with the rhythm and the color which is emitted by the contender, she will either follow him or respond by flash a special signal to attract the male. Scientists say fireflies produce light from their tail when heat resistant luciferin chemical combine with luciferase and oxygen to make light, due to these chemical and physical factors, the firefly which measures about 2.5 centimeters is capable to utilize 96% of energy to produce light comparted with fluorescent tube light which use 90% to produce light  while an ordinary bulb incandescent light utilize only 10% of energy to produce light while wasting the remaining amount of energy which reflects into the bill of the user in house, office or industry. Fireflies are predators who live by eating other insects including worms but some male turn into cannibals who use special light to attract female and catch, kill and eat them, scientists say the behaviour of cannibalism among fireflies is very rare and is believed to be practiced by old male because nectar from different flowers is believed to be their prime food, this enable the insect to have a life span of 61 to 65 days after spending more than 365 days in larvae. Scientists say a few days after mating, a female lays her fertilized eggs on or just below the surface of the ground, then the eggs hatch three to four weeks later, and the larvae feed until the end of the dry season. During cold seasons fireflies hibernate while on the larval stage, some species hibernate for several years while some do this by burrowing underground, while others find places on or under the bark of trees. In Tanzania fireflies can be seen in Njombe, Makambako, Lushoto, Kitulo, Monduli, Ngorongoro and the green belt around mount Kilimanjaro, kimulimuli is a Swahili name for these insects meanwhile like others in the savannah, the firefly is facing loss of habitat due to humans’ activities.
