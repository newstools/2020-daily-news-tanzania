THE government has warned people who run unregistered education centres that their days are numbered. The caution was given over the weekend by the Dar es Salaam Regional Education Officer (REO), Abdul Maulid, during the 21st graduation ceremony for Mbezi Beach Secondary. He said the unregistered education centres were causing chaos for students and their parents during national examinations period. “We are aware that there are mushrooming unregistered schools, which enroll students and when it comes to national examinations, they cause panic to students, parents and guardians,” he said. The REO said the government doors are opened for anyone, who needs to register his/her school, insisting that there was no need to operate clandestinely. Mr Maulid also congratulated Mbezi Beach Secondary School for their excellent performance in national examinations and urged them to maintain their status. On his side, the school Head Master, Kiramuu Mbowe thanked the government for putting a friendly environment for private schools to flourish. Mr Mbowe requested the support from the government, saying the school was facing myriads of challenges, which include lack of text books and laboratory equipment. In their speech, Form Four leavers commended the school for setting up good learning environment, saying, it was a secret behind their success in internal and external examinations. Speaking on behalf of Form Four leavers, Hamidu Awadhi said also at their Form Two national examinations, at least 90 per cent of the students did better because of the proper preparations of their teachers and the school’s management.
