MOSHI Urban Member of Parliament (MP)-elect Priscus Tarimo has promised to work hard and fulfill his promises and those of his party (CCM). He said he respected the decision of his voters to elect him. Mr Tarimo made the promise in Moshi at the weekend on the occasion of receiving a leadership wand presented to him by a Kilimanjaro-based international sculptor, Chief Athuman Mwariko. "I am indebted to the people of Moshi who showed their trust by electing me as their MP. I promise to reward their trust by working hard for the betterment of the constituency and their well-being," he said. Commenting on the leadership wand he was rewarded, Mr Tarimo said it would inspire him to work harder, remembering that the artist was the one who presented to Mwalimu Julius Nyerere a leadership wand. It was Chief Mwariko who carved Mwalimuâ€™s wand. He said as a mark following his historical victory as the first Moshi Urban MP-elect since the introduction of multi-party elections in the country 25 years ago. This is not the first time for Chief Mwariko to provide the leadership wand presents to leaders, as he had done so four times in the past, whereby apart from Mwalimu Nyerere who he presented him with two of them, one in the 1960s and another before retiring as President in 1985, he also rewarded retired President Jakaya Kikwete. He also rewarded US retired President Barak Obama a special leadership wand, which was presented to Mr Kikwete in 2015, so that procedures could be followed to reach the targeted recipient, Mr Obama.
