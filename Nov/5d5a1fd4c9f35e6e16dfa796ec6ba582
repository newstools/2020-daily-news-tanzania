IN a bid to support the improvement of education sector in the country, NBC bank has donated 4 tonnes of cement to Bukoba District Council to boost the construction of Ibosa primary school in the region. The support is part of its corporate social responsibility that aims at helping the ongoing construction of new five classrooms that will reduce shortage of classes facing the school currently. Speaking during the handover, the NBC Branch Manager for Bukoba, Mr Mathias Muhangirwa said the contribution targets at ensuring favorable learning environment for all students joining the school as a result of free education policy. He argued that success of the ongoing free education policy depends on the will of other players including the banking sector in supporting different necessities including expansion of infrastructures. “As part of our CSR, we decided to support the efforts by giving out a total of 4 tonnes of cement that we believe will help in the expansion of new 5 classrooms to cater the needs,” he said. The Acting Director for Bukoba District, Mr Babylus Mashauri said currently the school is facing shortage of five classrooms as it has a total of 789 students whereas according to the ministry standards it should have at least 14 classrooms. “We are facing a shortage of five classrooms as we only have nine of them forcing to overcrowd students on these few classes but with this support from NBC we will be able to extend other 5 classes for a more conducive learning environment for our students,” he said
