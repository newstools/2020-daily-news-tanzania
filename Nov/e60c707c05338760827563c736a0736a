THE management of Kilimanjaro Cooperative Bank Limited (KCBL) in Kilimanjaro has called stakeholders, private institutions and individuals in general to invest and utilise KCBL services. The appeal was made in Moshi recently by KCBL General Manager Godfrey Ng'ula, when talking to journalists recently. He said the first cooperative bank in the country had been strengthened following a new partnership between KCBL and CRDB Bank. "We intend to create a national cooperative bank and we ask cooperative institutions and other stakeholders to join forces with KCBL to achieve this end," he said. "May I take this opportunity to assure all cooperative institutions in the country and other stakeholders that KCBL is now strong enough to provide banking and financial services and because we are working in collaboration with CRDB Bank, we will be able to serve our clients better," he promised. "KCBL has revived, it is financially secure, services have improved and clients are depositing and withdrawing their money as usual. This is clear evidence that the bank is now safe ready to serve clients." He commended Kilimanjaro Native Cooperative Union (KNCU) for its significant contribution which he said included encouraging cooperative societies to work with KCBL. Recently, CRDB Bank Limited injected 7bn/- into KCBL, a move which had been described as a step towards making KCBL the country's biggest cooperative bank in the future.
