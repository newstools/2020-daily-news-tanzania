TANZANIA Bureau of Standards (TBS) in the Lake Zone has seized 60 cartons of 7,000 electrical cables. Speaking during the burning of the cables at Sayona Steel Factory in Buhongwa Ward, TBS Quality Control Officer Arnold Kubingwa said the cables were valued at over 5m/-. Mr Kubingwa said the products were smuggled into the country and test results showed they were substandard. The quality control officer added that TBS tested the electrical wires and found that they were of low quality that could lead to fire outbreaks. He urged members of the public to check products' information and report to TBS whose offices were everywhere in the country. Mr Kulindwa said TBS would continue fighting against substandard goods and ensuring that all entering and locally manufactured met quality requirements. He called up collaboration from honest stakeholders and traders, including shipping agents to ensure the importation of only quality products. "Poor products endanger people's health and the environment at large. TBS is here to prevent all possible damages,‚Äù he assured. Buhongwa resident Baraka Usaka expressed his gratitude to TBS for protecting Tanzanians against damage.
