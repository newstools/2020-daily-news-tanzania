NGORONGORO Heroes have to clear South Sudan hurdle to reach the finals of the CECAFA U-20 AFCON Regional Qualifiers at Black Rhino Academy in Karatu, Arusha on Monday (November 30,2020). Another hot semifinal match will see Uganda taking on Kenya in an early kickoff in a seemingly deadly tie as the both teams have had outstanding performances in their two past played games. In their latest results, Kenya defeated Sudan 2-1 to venture into the semis while Uganda outclassed Burundi 6-1 as such, everyone will be interested which side between them will smile at the end of 90 minutes. However, the country's boys still enjoy unbeaten run after succeeding in their previous two matches winning 6-1 against Djibouti in the inaugural match before thumping Somalia 8-1 to book a slot into the last four pack. They have since netted 14 goals and conceded two goals which gives them an upper hand to qualify into the finals and most importantly, earn a ticket to play in the AFCON tournament set next year. In both matches, the Heroes have stamped two hat tricks courtesy of Abdul Hamis who netted thrice against Djibouti and Kelvin John who also hit behind the net three times against Somalia as such, another hat trick can also emerge in tomorrow's encounter. Recently, Ngorongoro Heroes coach  Jamhuri Kihwelo  said they will amicably solve some of the problems he has observed in his squad so as to qualify to play in the AFCON finals next year. "Our mission is not only to win the title but rather to earn qualification of playing in the AFCON finals. I believe that our next game will be decisive as far as qualification is concerned. "Right now, what we need is to focus and win every game so as to once again take Tanzanians to the AFCON finals. As such, we will play with much energy to make sure that our target is reached," he said. He also disclosed that the problem of conceding goals despite posting big wins is something he will work at immediately prior to the last four encounters.
