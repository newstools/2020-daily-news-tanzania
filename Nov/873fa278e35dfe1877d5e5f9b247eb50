DODOMA, Tabora and Singida are three regions leading in production, packaging and exporting of honey to over 20 countries in the world, according to Tanzania Forest Service Agency (TFS). In an interview with the ‘Daily News’ recently, TFS Beekeeping Officer Frida Kundy said the agency would continue providing education to people so that honey produced in the country maintained its highest levels of quality. According to her, Tanzania exports honey mainly to Germany, England, Belgium, France and Italy. Others are Norway, Kenya, Uganda, Oman, Rwanda, Dubai, Japan, Canada, Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, Iran and the US. The beekeeping officer expressed optimism that generally the market for honey locally and internationally was superb, adding that plans were underway to explore the Chinese market. Apart from Tabora, Dodoma and Singida regions, Ms Kundy named other regions that were producing honey as Mbeya, Rukwa, Katavi, Iringa, Kigoma and Shinyanga. She also said there was also production of honeycomb which was exported outside the country and TFS planned to intensify its training programme to all beekeeping stakeholders. She noted that about 225 people from different groups had benefited from training. “While about 95 per cent of beekeepers capitalise on natural beekeeping, the remaining 5 per cent capitalise on modern beekeeping,” she added.
