ARA Petroleum Tanzania (APT) has set out a path to first gas at Tanzania’s Ruvuma production-sharing agreement (PSA). APT’s partners, Aminex and Scirocco Energy, provided updates on the new operator’s plans. The companies will acquire 3D seismic on a 454 square km area in the second and third quarters of 2021. Plans for the Chikumbi-1 well will kick up a gear in early 2021, the firm said. APT was established in 2018 to accelerate the development of the Ntorya area. After the farm-in APT will hold a 50per cent working interest, become the operator and conduct a minimum work programme. The work programme consists of drilling and testing the Chikumbi-1 well, in addition to acquiring a considerable quantity of 3D seismic data. Once the data has been acquired and analysed, it is likely that APT will prepare a Field Development Plan (FDP) and after approval from the various authorities in Tanzania commence the development. ARA Petroleum said it looks forward to working with various bodies in Tanzania in an effort to mature this very promising asset at the earliest possible opportunity.
