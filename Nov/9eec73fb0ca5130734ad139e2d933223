COUNCILORS of the German Capital city-Berlin have harmoniously agreed to rename Hermann Von Wissmann Road after Lucy Lameck, a former prominent Tanzanian activist. Herman Von Wissmann was a former Berlin governor accused of ordering murder during his leadership. The valid vote cast by Berlin suggested the name of former governor should be changed to Lucyâ€™s one. Before this decision, the origin name of the Road was Wissmanntrabe before being renamed after Herman Von Wissmann. Born to a farming family in Kilimanjaro Region in 1934, Lucy Lameck was one among the women who fought for the Independence of Tanzania while striving to strengthen women's position in the society. The trained nurse was the first woman to hold a Ministerial post in the first phase government under Father of the Nation, Julius Nyerere.
