INDUSTRIALISATION has started paying off after the value of local manufactured goods in the country rose significantly by over 12 per cent in a year to June. The value of manufactured goods was pushed up by South Eastern Zone—Mtwara, Lindi, Coast and Ruvuma—which went up by 78.2 per cent for the year ending this June. The zonal industrial goods value year-on-year almost doubled to 1.708tri/- from 958.8bn/-. The value of the four regions was the highest in the period and the nearest zone, southern highlands, grew by 9.0 per cent. According to the Bank of Tanzania (BoT)’s Consolidated Zonal Economic Performance Report for June, the growth was due to an increase in the number of factories and expansion of regional markets. “All zones registered increases in the value of manufactured commodities, partly attributed to a number of factors, including the expansion of regional market outreach,” the BoT report said. The report showed that the Southern Highlands value of manufactured goods jumped from 609.3bn/- to 664.1bn/- to come second while on third slots was Dar es Salaam raised by 6.7 per cent from 5.51tri/- to 5.88tri/-. The fourth in line was Central Zone whose value of industrial goods jumped almost 3.0 per cent from 407.7bn/- to 419.3bn/-, while the Northern Zone followed with almost 2.0 per cent from 1.29tri/- to 1.32tri/-. Lake Zone registered the negative growth of 10.9 per cent from 619.4bn/- to 552.1bn/-. However, Dar es Salaam’s total value of goods per year was the highest. It was almost one and half more than the rest of the five zones combined. Dar es Salaam’s contribution was 55.8 per cent of the total. It was followed by Southern Eastern that contributed 16.2 per cent while, third on the list was Northern Zone—Arusha, Kilimanjaro, Tanga and Manyara—at 12.5 per cent. In total, selected manufactured commodities grew by 12.1 per cent in value to 10.54tri/- from the level registered in the preceding year. “Dar es Salaam, South Eastern and Northern zones accounted for 84.5 per cent of the total value of manufactured goods,” the BoT report showed. In 2019, the Lake Zone continued accounting for the largest share of zonal GDP at market price of 25.9 per cent, followed by Northern Zone of 17.2 per cent and the Dar es Salaam Zone of 17.1 per cent. In nominal terms, GDP per capita increased in all zones, with Dar es Salaam Zone recording the highest per capita, followed by Northern Zone. Per capita GDP for Dar es Salaam, Northern, Southern Highlands and South Eastern zones were above the national level of 2.577m/-, while those of Lake and Central zones were below the national per capita at 1.9m/-.
