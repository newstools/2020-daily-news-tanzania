COMMISSIONER for Social Welfare in the Ministry of Health, Community Development, Gender, Elderly and Children Naftali Ng’ondi has directed social workers to close down all unqualified childcare centres to protect children. He directed this mid-week during the Tanzania Association of Social Workers (Taswo)’s three-day annual meeting, which attracted social workers from across Tanzania. “Yes.... closing them is part of your responsibilities. I direct you to protect children’s welfare. Child protection is one of your priorities. Put in place mechanisms to let members of the public understand the scope of your responsibilities,” he insisted. The commissioner also directed Taswo to organise capacity building workshops from time to time to sharpen the knowledge and skills of its members and improve service delivery. Gracing the event, Regional Commissioner (RC) John Mongela supported the idea, saying social workers had responsibilities, which were not well-communicated to people. “For instance, there are many challenges in our society caused by globalisation, especially to the youth and children, of which you, social workers should be in the frontline to ensure this generation is not spoiled in any way,” said the RC, adding: “Social workers have also important role to play in fire accidents, famine, floods, accidents and poverty eradication.” However, the RC thanked social workers for service during the Mv Nyerere accident on Ukara Island in Ukerewe District about two years ago. Alternative Education Programme Coordinator in the Nongovernmental Children Village Tanzania Organisation Husna Selungwi assured Taswo of collaboration to improve childcare. Taswo vice-chairman Awadh Mohamed commented that discussing how best to promote social justice at national, regional global levels as well as enhance the wellbeing of people, was part of such a three-day meeting’s objectives.
