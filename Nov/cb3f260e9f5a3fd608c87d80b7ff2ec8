President Magufuli showed the direction his government would be taking in different sectors of the economy, including strengthening friendly relations with regional economic groupings such as the East African Community (EAC), Southern African Development Community (SADC) and the international community. Stressing this point, President Magufuli invited individuals and companies from Tanzania and other parts of the world to invest in the country for the very fact that the fifth phase government has and will continue creating a friendly investment environment “and the time to utilise investment opportunity is this one.” Various analysts and people have commended President John Magufuli’s inaugural speech, saying “it is forward looking and gives the direction the country will take towards building a truly industrial economy.” We don’t want to reproduce what newspapers, radio and TV stations and social media have already reported, but it suffices to say that it is now time to build our nation which has qualified for the middle-income economy status five years before 2025 as stipulated in the National Development Vision 2025. The Vision provides that the following specific achievements would be attainable by 2025: high quality livelihood, good governance and the rule of law and a strong and competitive economy. Perhaps it is time we Tanzanians started behaving and conducting our affairs as people from a middle-income economy and not from a poor country as many people could still be thinking. Seeing what is done in different parts of the country – both in terms of macro and micro economic activities in the country – there are indicators that were on track and may be what we should not do is to turn back, but to keep the fire of a prosperous Tanzania burning. As President Magufuli stressed related to this in his inaugural speech is that he wouldn’t like to see leaders delaying any investment or development projects. So, let us build Tanzania towards a bright future.
