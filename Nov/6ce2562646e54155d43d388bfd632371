FOLLOWING completion of the general election in the country, members of the Zanzibar House of Representatives have started a two-week induction programme that orients them towards their new role in the country. The induction programme, which aims at preparing them for the implementation of their constitutional mandate and fulfilling their pledges they made during election campaigns, was opened on Thursday with facilitators urging them to be closer to their voters. The House of Representatives organised training for its members to receive practical guidance on House business and attend seminars on specific topics related to their role such as human rights, gender equality and constituency outreach and media relations. "During the induction week, both new and old legislators will have an opportunity to meet each other and know the House staff. It is important that they understand House regulations and their role in constituencies," said House Clerk Raya Msellem. Lecturer & Head of the Department of Law at Zanzibar University (ZU), Dr Yahya Khamis Hamad, and Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) Ibrahim Mzee Ibrahim are facilitating the induction programme. The facilitators reminded the lawmakers of their legislative, oversight and representative functions and broader constitutional responsibilities, as Dr Yahya emphasised "listening to people in respective areas so that challenges facing them can be addressed." Dr Yahya also talked about maintaining integrity and respect for the House by avoiding corruption and fraud practices, the use of foul language and unethical dressing which are contrary to traditional practices and norms. DPP explained about the history and development of the Zanzibar House of Representatives and the House had recorded admirable development which included an increase in the legislators from five special seats in 1980 to the current 20 or more and elected members from constituencies from 10 in 1980 to current 50 seats.
