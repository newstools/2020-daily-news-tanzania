IT was all but smile to Tanzanian lady Joyce Ndyetabura who overcome stiff opposition to win her first CEOs (Chief Executives Officers) title at the Sea Cliff Resort course in Zanzibar over the weekend. Ndyetabura was unstoppable when on that day she fired three-under par 39 stable ford points to win this year’s title. She defeated other ladies and men’s CEOs, diplomats and other top golfers from East African and beyond in the 18- hole annual tournament. According to the Sea Cliff Resorts Golf Club manager Elias Soka, Ndyetabura beat a strong field of over 50 golfers who were engaged in the race for the event’s top honour. Ndyetabura beat her closest challenger Steve Chiwalo from Uganda who posted 37 points to finish runner up on countback after he had tied with the Ernest Sengeu from Kenya on the same score. The luxury retreat golf day saw host Brendon Bisset playing impressively after returning a par level 36 points to finish at the forth position, while Kyle Veitch of South Africa and the former Tanzania Golf Union (TGU) Chairman Joseph Tango also tied on 33 points to finish fifth and sixth position respectively. Vicky Elias carded 33 points to win the ladies title as Kenyan Maryanne Mugo continued to cling at the second position as she did last week during the Diplomatic Golf tournament at Kili Golf Club in Arusha. Anita Siwale, who two years ago won overall CEO’s title in Zanzibar, could not repeat her form this time, but she did not return home empty- handed.
