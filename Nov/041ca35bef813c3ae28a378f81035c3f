TANZANIAN pugilist Ibrahim Mgender ‘Ibrah Classic’ will step on the PTA Hall ring in Dar-Es-Salaam today to trade punches with Zambian Simon Ngoma in super featherweight fight. Ibrahim will be defending his Global Boxing Council (WBC) World Light weight Title he won in 2017 against a Panama opponent, Jose Forero in Hangelsberg, Germany. Simon arrived in the country last month with his trainer Anthony Mwamba for the preparations. The organisers have made it aware that the regular entrance fee is 10,000/- while 20,000/- is for the VIP. Ibrahim Class began his boxing career in 2010 where he had fought 29 bouts and won 23 of which 11 by knockouts. He has lost six of them. While his opponent Ngoma began the boxing three years ago and has stepped in the ring seven times. He has won six fights of which four by knockout and lost one. In reference to the stats from each boxer, it seems Ibrahim Class is more experienced than his Zambian opponent, but the question is would the experience matter? In seven of the bouts that he has fought at home, he won thrice and four times in abroad; winning three and lost once. He has not been defeated since 2018, and since his defeat from Peter Pambeni in Harare, Zimbabwe, he has won four consecutive games with three of them by knockout. According to boxer’s website, Ibrahim Class had no best records between 2018 and 2019 as he fought twice and in both bouts he lost by knockout. Things seemed to have changed in 2020 where he fought twice and won both, considered to have improved. Most of Ibrahim Classic victories have been recorded at home, giving him the advantage in the forthcoming bout, considering to the fact that he will have a ‘home ground advantage’. The supporting bouts will see Haidari Chanjo fighting against Saidi Chino while Ally Ngwando facing Hamidu Kwata.
