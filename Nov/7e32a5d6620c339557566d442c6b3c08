President John Magufuli has assured Regional Commissioners and District commissioners that he has no plans of doing any changes in their posts, hence, they work hard. Speaking in an event of swearing-in the government’s Attorney General at Chamwino state house in Dododma earlier today (November 9, 2020), President Magufuli said his re-election does not mean he has plans to alter the previous government administrators’ posts, but in particular would address positions like the Prime Minister’s, the Speaker and Deputy speaker, which have to be voted for. Elaborating, Dr.Magufuli said he has no regrets selecting and working with the current Regional and District commissioners, adding that his next five years leadership still prefers them. However, he called upon government officials to work hard.
