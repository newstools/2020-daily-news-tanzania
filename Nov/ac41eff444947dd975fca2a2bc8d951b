THE Office of the Chief Government Statistician (OGCS)-Zanzibar in collaboration with development partners, on Tuesday launched the action plan for improving gender statistics in the Islands, a move that is likely to end data discrepancy. “Need to improve gender statistics comes from Zanzibar’s strategy for growth and poverty reduction (ZSGRP) and from a key commitment of the 2030 agenda for sustainable Development to ensure that ‘No One is left Behind,” Ms Mayasa Mahfoudh Mwinyi- Director of OGCs said at a short ceremony to launch the three-year plan beginning October 2020. She informed stakeholders at the ceremony here that in order to meet this commitment of leaving no one behind, data used to measure progress must be disaggregated, not only by sex but also by age, location education, employment, disability status, and inclusive of vulnerable groups. At the meeting which was among activities or events lined-up to mark the ‘African Statistics Day (Nov 18)’, she said her office had taken different measures and affirmative actions to mainstream gender statistics in the development process, although there are still a number of challenges that need to be addressed with consolidated efforts from different stakeholders. She said that due to inadequate capacity of sectors in production and management of gender statistics, it has led to low performance, low quality statistics, difficulty in obtaining timely data, and insufficient statistics at disaggregated levels. The action plan includes conducting quarterly meetings with stakeholders, visit data producers regularly, review data collection tools, conduct trainings for data producers, prepare media programmes with focus of vital statistics (marriage and divorces), migration, and crime statistics. Director of Programmes at the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development data, Mr Davis Adieno joined the launching ceremony in Zanzibar through Zoom, promising that his organisation is fully committed to work with Zanzibar OCGS to improve data in the Islands. Minister of Labour, Empowerment, Elderly, Women and Children, Deputy Principal Secretary (dPS) Ms Mauwa Makame was the guest of honour at the ceremony, and her message to the audience was “We need to work together to improve data because it is crucial in planning for development.” Among the stakeholders who attended the ceremony included officers from UN offices (UNFPA, UNDP), government agencies, immigration, staff from OCGS, planning Commission, and media.
