PRESIDENT John Magufuli has started forming his cabinet by appointing two ministers, Prof Palamagamba Kabudi and Dr Phillip Mpango. While Prof Kabudi has been appointed Minister for Foreign Affairs and East African Cooperation, Dr Mpango is appointed Minister for Finance and Planning. Both have been retained to their positions that they were serving during the first tenure of office – that’s from 2015 to this year. “The appointment of the two ministers starts with effect from November 13, 2020,” reads part of the statement issued by Director of Presidential Communications Gerson Msigwa yesterday. The two were among the nominated MPs in the 11th Parliament, but this time they vied for constituency seats in the October 28 general election. Prof Kabudi vied for Kilosa Constituency in Morogoro Region, his colleague Dr Mpango contested for Buhigwe Constituency in Kigoma Region. The appointment of the two ministers has come just a day after President Magufuli nominated Mr Kassim Majaliwa to the position of Prime Minister, who was also endorsed by Parliament in Dodoma on Thursday. Mr Majaliwa’s nomination makes him serve the second term as Premier, following his successful five years’ term in office after his 2015 first appointment. Recently, President Magufuli said there would be changes in ministerial posts in which some of the Members of Parliament had stumbled in their reelection bid, while new faces surfaced. He made the statement on Monday during the swearing-in event of the Attorney General (AG), Prof Adelardus Kilangi, at Chamwino Statehouse in Dodoma. “I cannot hide it. There will be changes in ministerial posts in the wake of the general election, and the fact I have wider choices because of the number of CCM MPs elected,” he said.
