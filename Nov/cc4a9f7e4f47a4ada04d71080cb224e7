Delivering the verdict, Magistrate Nickson Temu said the accused was sentenced to serve 30 years in jail for raping and another three-year jail term for breaking the leg of the victim. “Since the sentences will go concurrently the accused will serve 30 years in jail,” the, magistrate said. According to the magistrate, the prosecution side had proved the case against the accused beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused had indeed committed the offence. “The act he committed is inhuman and very barbaric ... I pass this severe sentence so that it serves as a lesson not only to him, but also deter others with similar behaviour,” he ruled. The trial magistrate further told the court that the accused had committed the offence against Section 130(1) and (2)(e) of Penal Code (R.E 16, 2019). The prosecution side, led by Inspector of Police Rajabu Ndunda, charged before the court that Gabriel committed the offence of rape on July 13, this year, at Kazombwe Village.
