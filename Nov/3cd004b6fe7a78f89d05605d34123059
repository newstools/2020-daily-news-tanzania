FARMERS in Katavi region have been asked to take advantage of the opportunities offered by financial institutions in taking input loans to boost their commercial viability and boost output. The statement was issued by NMB Bank Manager, Mpanda branch in Katavi region, Alex Massawe at the opening of a special meeting with farmers and traders in the region. Mr Massawe said the bank has been meeting with farmers in different areas with the aim of providing them with agribusiness education that will help in raising their activities in the sector. “This is the first time for NMB here to hold a special meeting with farmers, so it is upon you to use this opportunity to achieve immediate success,” added Mr Massawe. Commenting on the input loans, NMB bank Senior Relationship Manager, Business Banking, Wogofya Mfalamagoha, said their financial institution provides loans of different inputs to farmers, whose repayment is only once a year for a period of three years. “For example, we give you a tractor that you are working on and pay only once a year. We are not like other banks which force you to pay every month, because we are looking at the strength of the investment made,” he said. In addition, a representative from NMB Foundation, Rogers Shipela confirmed that the institute will continue providing various training to farmers. “The NMB foundation is designed with the aim of providing entrepreneurship training so that a farmer will be able to sell his produce at a price that will benefit him, and in addition we provide marketing education that is provided so that the farmer can sell his produce effectively,” he added.
