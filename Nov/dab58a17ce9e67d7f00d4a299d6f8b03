THE National Food Reserve Agency (NFRA) in Sumbawanga Zone will start purchasing both maize and rice during next year’s buying season from Rukwa and Katavi regions respectively. NFRA Acting Manager in Sumbawanga Zone Marwa Range said this to ‘Daily News’ during an exclusive interview in Sumbawanga on Sunday. “This purchasing season NFRA in Sumbawanga Zone has been allocated 3,000 tonnes of rice to Sumbawanga, but we failed to buy it due to lack of good quality because farmers plant low quality rice seeds. The next purchasing season if possible we will purchase rice from farmers who cultivate it using quality rice seeds with required standard from irrigation schemes in Rukwa and Katavi regions,” he explained. He further explained that this purchasing maize season, which started July this year, NFRA had planned to buy 55,000 tonnes and already 11,169 tonnes and 91kg had been purchased. “This purchasing maize season no restrictions have been imposed and the market is open for Agriculture Marketing Cooperative Society (Amcos) and traders and, therefore, farmers are allowed to sell their maize to NFRA provided they meet requisite standards and quality,” he said. Mr Range mentioned NFRA’s purchasing maize in Sumbawanga Zone centres as Mazwi in Sumbawanga Urban, Laela and Mtowisa centres in Sumbawanga District Council, Namanyere (Nkasi) Mwimbi and Matai (Kalambo). Purchasing centres in Katavi Region are in Mpanda Town, Milumba and Kibaoni and at Kibaoni puchasing centre 669 tonnes and 602kg have been bought.
