MWANZA city petty traders have said the completion of the 13bn/- Kirumba market will serve in setting proper and permanent trading areas for small scale traders, ‘machinga’ who used to interfere with the markets’ trading system. One of the traders, Mr Hosea Kondo said in an interview here that, “Machinga should also have permanent trading areas, instead of roving and causing disturbances to other traders” Another trader, Mr Eseli Kalisa commended the peaceful 2020 general election that gave CCM victory, and was quick to say that it will make timely accomplishment of transport infrastructures, mostly the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR), hence, affordability in goods’ transport expenses. He said currently, transport charges for goods are high, which causes high prices for food-related goods in the markets. “Many traders are willing to set up reasonable food prices, but various levies, plus high transport charges among others, limit us. Improvement of transport infrastructures therefore will favour us all, both sellers and consumers,” he said. The market’s Chairperson, Mr Elias Daudi affirmed that the project was set to take off from early last month, but was postponed to pave way for the general election. During the rainy season, most of businesses were affected when the whole market is surrounded by water as a result of poor infrastructure. The Chairperson made the call for relevant authorities to consider traders’ involvement before market construction activities takeoff, so that they can hear their advice, mostly on goods’ arrangements in the market since traders are currently doing business randomly
