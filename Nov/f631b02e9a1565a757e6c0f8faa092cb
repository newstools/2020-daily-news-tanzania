PRODUCTION of cassava in Tanzania has significantly increased from 5.9 million tonnes to 8.2 million tonnes within a period of one year, the Director of Crops in the Ministry of Agriculture, Nyasebwa Chimagu said on Tuesday. However, despite the increase, production of the vital economic cash crop remains relatively low in the country in comparison to the high demand from within and outside the country, especially in China that consumes more than 2 million tonnes of dry cassava, equivalent to 6million tonnes of fresh cassava every year. In an interview with the ‘Daily News’, Mr Chimagu said low production was attributed to low use of improved seed, low application of improved technologies, unreliable climatic conditions as well as presence of diseases, among others. According to him during the 2016/17 season at least 1,202,216 hectors of cassava were cultivated and producing a total of 4, 025,265 tonnes, adding that: “The low production was caused by prolonged droughts in major cassava growing zones.” The director further said that during 2017/18 season, the country grew cassava in a total of 983,502 hectors and harvested 8,372,211 tonnes, and in 2018/ 2019 farming season, the county got 8,184, 093 tonnes from 990,835 hectors. “We are putting several measures in place to improve the country’s production level with an eye to meeting growing demand domestically and in away markets,” he observed. Cassava Desk Officer, Upendo Mndeme, noted that the ministry of agriculture has developed some diverse strategies that will double the current production as a result of increasing quality cassava seed varieties and training farmers as well as extension officers on better agronomic practices.
