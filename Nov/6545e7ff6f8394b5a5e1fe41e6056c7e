AMREF Health Africa Tanzania has handed over telecommunication equipment to the Ministry of Health, Community Development, Gender, Elderly and Children that will facilitate training on outbreak of diseases without affecting services. Director of Curative Services in the Ministry, Dr Grace Magembe said the equipment included laptops, protectors and router for internet. She said under the programme, 12-regions will benefit, which include Mbeya, Dodoma, Dar es Salaam, Arusha, Iringa, Kilimanjaro, Morogoro, Tanga, Songwe and Mwanza among others. Dr Magembe said under the programme, staff will be trained on how to handle and deal with outbreak of diseases at their point of work so that patients will keep on enjoying services. “It has come to our attention that when staff go for training, they disturb service delivery, therefore under the programme they will be learning and attending to patients at their job areas” said Dr Magembe. Earlier, Amref Tanzania Project Manager, Dr Serafina Mkuwa said the project is part of their support to the government to strengthen the health sector. She said the equipment will help the government to reach health workers through virtual platform with training and technical support in ensuring that essential health services continue to be provided even during outbreaks. “These devices as a whole are 40 sets (40 laptops, 40 projectors and 40 wireless internet routers for 40 health facilities) will implement project activities to ensure continued essential health services during pandemic” said Dr Mkuwa. She expressed their commitment for continuing to be a major government partner in strengthening the health sector in the country. She further urged the government to ensure that the project is implemented effectively to meet the government expectations as Amref Health Africa focuses on equipment investment to achieve the intended project goals.
