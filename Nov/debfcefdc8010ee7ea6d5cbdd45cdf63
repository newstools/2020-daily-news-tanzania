PRELIMINARY assessment of the Zanzibar Electoral Commission (ZEC)’s performance after the October General elections shows that it urgently requires a building with a larger space for future use. This was revealed at the meeting between ZEC officials and the newly appointed Minister of State (Second Vice President, Policy, Coordination and House of Representatives) Dr Khalid Mohamed Salim. “We have been operating at a confined space prompting the electoral commission to rent a space during the election process,” Mr Thabit Idarious Faina- Director ZEC said at the meeting held at their offices in Maisara. Mr Faina informed the minister that despite the challenge, the October elections were successful and that good planning for elections enabled them to save more than 2.46bn/- from the election budget of 9.04bn/-. “We managed to spend no more than 6.58bn/- out of the budget. The money covered election requirements plus costs of constructing a new ZEC district office for ‘Unguja West A’ district, fencing of Unguja Central District ZEC offices, renovation of ZEC offices in Pemba including election materials store at Micheweni,” he pointed out. In response, Dr Salum commended ZEC for the good work of managing the general elections and good expenditure, saying: “Your meeting which engaged ZEC staff in Pemba through video conference was also the best way to minimize costs.” The minister advised ZEC officers to maintain the financial discipline, team working, and commitment and protect ZEC properties including acquiring title-deeds, adding: “We want to see changes in all public offices.”
