STATISTICIANS have been urged to visit households so that they may have data they can compile for reports. National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) Statistician General, Dr Albina Chuwa, said at the weekend when addressing statisticians preparing for visiting households to collect data. Dr Chuwa said it would be meaningless if a report would reflect theoretical instead of practical and depict the real situation in the households and what the people were facing. She visited her staff and wanted to know the developments of the exercise in preparations for facts up to the time of her visit. Among other things, the residents of respective households were supposed to say how they accessed social services such as health, water and education. “We have decided to prepare a report on income and expenditure in households in Manyara Region at this place because we still need to go back to respective households, make follow-ups and verify the information we have received before the final report is produced,” insisted Dr Chuwa. The statistician general said it was the people themselves who were supposed to share their experiences and she called on the experts collecting data to ensure the report was ready by next month as it was the one expected to guide the government in its plans through 2025. “We have indicators as of what the people have spoken about. We have completed data collection and comments by the people so that we can know what we should do to move in the right direction,” she said, adding that the book would be both in Kiswahili and English languages so that many people could understand the contents. She said priority of the Ministry of Finance and Planning was for the people to read, understand and use the information for development plans.
