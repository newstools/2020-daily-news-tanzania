A 10.1bn/- newly ‘Mother and Child’ facility at Sekou-Toure Regional Referral Hospital is set to be in use next year. The new building, whose construction took off in 2017, will have the capacity to accommodate 261 beds, two theatre rooms and two labour wards, hospital in-charge, Dr Bahati Msaki, told the ‘Daily News’ recently. It is a five-storey building that will also involve an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for mothers and babies, According to Dr Msaki. “We really need this facility due to, among other things, an increase in the number of mothers who deliver at hospital. Between 20 and 30 mothers do give birth here daily.” “At least five to six expectant mothers undergo surgery every day,” said the in-charge, stressing: “the new facility will be helpful as the current one accommodates only 120 beds, with other services for mother and child being offered in general rooms (shared with other patients).” The shift of mother and child services to the new building will pave the way for the expansion of other health services, including Orthopedics and Traumatology Department. The department’s specialist, Dr Kelvin Nyakimori said osteomyelitis services as well as physiotherapy for nerves stimulation were set to shift. He clarified that osteomyelitis was the service that involved repairing of the bone, stressing: “We also expect to start implanting, hence the shift of mother and child services will give enough space,” said the specialist.
