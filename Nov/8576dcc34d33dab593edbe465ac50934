THE Under-20 National Football team ‘Ngorongoro heroes’ hope to seal a place in CECAFA U20 CHAMPIONSHIP semifinals should they beat Somalia today at Black Rhino Academy Stadium in Arusha. Ngorongoro Heroes will walk confidently with the backup of their hefty 6-1 victory over Djibouti at Black Rhino Academy Stadium last Sunday. The victory gave Ngorongoro command of Group A, collecting three points similar to Djibouti who are second in the log but superior by goal difference. Should they win, they will then collect six points. In case Djibouti smashes Ngorongoro then the only team which will take through to the semi will depend on the goal difference. Djibouti collected three after registering 2-1 win this Tuesday over Somalia. Thus, Somalia is at the bottom of the group, in case they lose to Tanzania they will probably not progress to the semifinals. The CECAFA competition has been super exciting for some national teams such as Tanzania and Kenya whereas both have banked not less than three goals. Kenya on their hand smashed Ethiopia 3-0 at Sheikh Amri Abeid Memorial Stadium in Arusha. Kenya is on top of Group C with three points on ledger while remaining with one game to complete group stage. In Group B, things are kind of tight as the leaders South Sudan and Uganda led by one point after a barren draw in the first encounter. Burundi has yet not stepped on the pitch and therefore has not collected any point. Meanwhile, the Ngorongoro Heroes Head Coach Jamhuri Kihwelo has made it aware that his goal is to seal a place in the World Cup that will only be possible if the youth squad steps in CECAFA finals which will automatically handle them a ticket to AFCON. After securing a place in AFCON, they will be required to be among the top four teams. In which the four top teams will automatically seal their place to the World Cup finals.
