M-LIPA platform has partnered with KwikPay to facilitate payments to businesses from their end consumers. M-Lipa Manager Geofrey Mwaijonga said in Dar es Salaam at the weekend that, “This partnership aims at bringing specialisation between both parties and ensure each party focuses on their strengths at all times.” As a licensed cashless payment solution by the Bank of Tanzania (BoT), M-Lipa enables businesses to make collections and disbursements via multiple cashless channels. “We strongly believe that, with KwikPay our clients will have the best payment solution for their end consumers at all times,” he said. For his part, an official from KwikPay, Mr Paschal Giki, said KwikPay was an application that bypassed conventional USSD processes in the mobile money payment procedures. “With KwikPay, M-Lipa business clients can enable their consumers to make payments safer and quicker with minimal steps via QR code or bypassed USSD steps. The two platforms aim at ensuring both the business and the end consumer get the best payment solutions offering end to end solutions to our clients,” he said. A move to improve cashless mobile payments, which is enabled by development of the ICT technology across the world, reflects the government’s vision to improve the lives of Tanzanians by using ICT technology. When inaugurating the 12th Parliament in Dodoma last week, President John Magufuli said since most of the activities in the world today depended on ICT technology’s creativity, his government would prioritise the same. He said it would improve the use of mobile phones and the network to be accessed all over the country, and increasing internet users from 43 per cent to 80 per cent.
