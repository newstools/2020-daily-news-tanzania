YARA Tanzania has launched a new product known as MiCROP that aims at helping maize and rice smallholders to get more yields. The new product was launched during Yara Tanzania annual dealers’ conference held in Dar es Salaam at the weekend. Speaking during the launch, Yara Tanzania Managing Director Winstone Odhiambo said the new blended fertiliser, which targets small-scale farmers, had zinc and sulphur micronutrients required for stronger and better crops. “We are proud to launch MiCROP fertiliser today where maize and rice smallholder farmers will get more yields hence more incomes and foodstuffs,” he said. According to Mr Odhiambo, the fertiliser will be blended locally at Yara Tanzania plant in Dar es Salaam. “This is in line with the government’s initiative to promote an industrial economy as this time round we are producing it right here,” he said. He called on farmers to utilise MiCROP for better yields, adding that it would be distributed countrywide. Meanwhile, Yara Tanzania held its annual conference with dealers, an event where the company and its dealers reviewed the year and planned for the coming year. During the event, dealers who surpassed their targets were also recognised and rewarded. Yara Tanzania is the leading crop nutrition company in Africa and millions of farmers have undergone training on better and sustainable farming techniques that have a greater and profitable yield for farmers. Yara Tanzania manufactures high quality fertilisers available all over the continent at any time and works in partnership with farmers’ institutions, community-based organisations, nongovernmental organisations in offering education and nutritional solutions to improve their livelihoods
