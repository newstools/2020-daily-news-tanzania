ISUYI villagers in Kizengi Ward, Uyui District, are now getting reliable and efficient telecommunications services, thanks to the launch of a new telecoms tower in the area at the weekend. Speaking at the launch, Uyui District Commissioner Gift Msuya, who represented Tabora Regional Commissioner, urged residents to utilise communications services for security and development initiatives. “I urge Isuli residents to utilise the telecoms tower to boost the economy by investing and conducting search on new market opportunities in and outside the country,” Ms Msuya said. She called on the residents to report to security organs all those who vandalised the telecoms infrastructure. The DC commended Tanzania Telecommunications Corporation (TTCL) for making possible the telecom connection of Alex-Uyui, Buhekela- Igunga, Nsenda Mlimani-Urambo, Isuli-Uyui, Shilla-Nzega, Nsogoro-Urambo, Usunga-Sikonge, Malagano-Igunga villages. Other villages are Ngulu Mpakani-Igunga, Igoweko-Uyui, Nyaua-Uyui and Magua-Sikonge where the projects are ongoing. For his part, TTCL Director-General Waziri Kindamba urged Isuli residents to ensure the telecoms infrastructure was protected against any act of vandalism. “It is our obligation and we should collaborate to ensure the telecoms infrastructure is protected,” he emphasised. Mr Kindamba appealed to the residents to ensure TTCL services were affordable, but also as meant to generate incomes by selling TTCL airtime cards and T-Pesa agents. The DG said TTCL would continue supporting various government initiatives aimed at improving telecommunications services in the rural and border areas of the country. Speaking at the event, Igalula legislator Venant Daudi commended TTCL for connecting Isuli residents to reliable telecoms services that would support them in their economic activities.
