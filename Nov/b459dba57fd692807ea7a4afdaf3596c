TANZANIA Media Women Association, Zanzibar (Tamwa–Zanzibar) has organised a one-day walk exercise to encourage youth’s behavioural change related to sexual abuse, including rape and sodomy. The walk will take place on Saturday (November 28, 2020) from Machomane to Gombani Stadium, South Pemba Region and is in response to the escalating acts of sexual violence in Zanzibar, which are largely perpetrated by young people and middle-aged men, who ruin the future of victims’ lives. According to Tamwa’s press statement signed by the Tamwa-Zanzibar Director, Dr Mzuri Issa, the walk exercise will be led by Gombani Exercise Group, while other physical exercise groups will also join the campaign with the same intention to minimise sexual harassment acts. Therefore, the ‘Gombani group’ will offer a variety of exercises that help people especially sexually active persons to minimise or get rid of rape concept from their minds so that they become responsible citizens. Ms Issa said in the statement that the event was one of the planned activities in collaboration with stakeholders of Tamwa-Zanzibar and stakeholders during the ‘16 days of activism’ which started on November 25 and ends on December 10. “This important event is in line with this year’s theme “Oppose Sexual Violence: Changes Start with Me” also in line with a customised message from Tamwa-Zanzibar “Exercise to control emotions: Leave a baby girl safe,” part of the statement reads. The exceptional event in Pemba is expected to bring together various stakeholders in the fight against violence, especially the violence directed towards women and children, to discuss the situation and come up with workable strategies. As the world marks ‘16 Days of Activism,’ Tamwa-Zanzibar also calls on the community to use these days as a catalyst for behavioural change and fostering a physical exercise culture among men to protect themselves from engaging in sexual violence in the community.
