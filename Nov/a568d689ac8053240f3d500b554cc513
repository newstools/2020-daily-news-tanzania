THE founder and Director of iCARRE Foundation from the United States of America, Rodney Carr has said he will work with Tasuba college of Arts to build a sports academy that will initially start with Baseball Training in the country. Carr said this during a visit to the college’s grounds recently where it was hosting the ‘4th International Conference on Art for Social Transformation: ARTIZEN 2020’. The plan is to merge the gap between Tanzania and through sports diplomacy, specifically through baseball training, he commented. “As I saw the campus, I automatically got goose bumps because I saw what I have been dreaming about, which is building a sports academy in Tanzania. By the end of the conference we plan to have enough traction so that we can make proper connection needed to be done to move forward with the plans,” he said. Mr Carr who is also the key note speaker of the conference revealed that the final goal is to be able to bring a team from Baltimore to compete in Tanzania and later exchange. He explained that there is a lot of artistic values in sports that illustrate culture and traditions of a society, and that is why they have brought together arts and sports. He elaborated that the conference is designed to engage all sectors in society into artist-led exploration and inquiry; as arts culture has the ability to reactivate the art possibility needed for practitioners of every sector to stimulate innovation and growth. The Tasuba Principal Dr Herbert Makoye noted that through the conference arts and culture of the country will be enhanced and provide more economic opportunities in the society. "We are glad for the visit as it aims at investing in the country through arts, culture and sports to fight poverty and bring about creative and innovative ways of sustainable development. Tanzania is utilising its artists in creating awareness and educating the society, but this opportunity will bring about even more development,” he stated.
