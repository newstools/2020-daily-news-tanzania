THE Institute of Rural Development Planning (IRDP) in collaboration with UNDP is undertaking a major project that will lead to the construction of special cold rooms to assist fishermen in the country. The project, currently being undertaken in Mwanza Region, will also see installation of a modern plant for the production of special ice blocks needed in preserving fish according to the internationally recommended standards before any exportation. In an interview with the ‘Daily News’ here, IRDP’s Rector, Professor Hozen Mayaya, said the project was part of a series of diverse strategies being initiated by the state- owned institute to support the fifth phase government’s efforts to industrialise the country and eradicate poverty from grassroots level. And he added, in complementing the middle income and industrial economies, the institute in partnership with other key development partners, like European Union (EU) and international organisations like UNICEF had also implemented useful projects for construction of several industries in different parts of the country. “For instance, in Dodoma Region we have so far managed to open a leather processing factory and sunflower oil plant…apart from stimulating the economic growth in the central zone corridor, the two factories are playing a useful role in improving service delivery, as well as creating direct and indirect job opportunities to youth communities,” he pointed out. Professor Mayaya further said that, the establishment of the Dodoma-based high learning institute was centred on empowering ordinary citizens in rural areas and remove them from shackles of poverty. However, for her part, the chairperson of the IRDP Governing Council, Professor Martha Qorro, noted that the Dodomabased institute will continue to produce potential human resources that are ready to work decently in empowering rural communities to understand, grab, and using key economic potential available in their areas.
