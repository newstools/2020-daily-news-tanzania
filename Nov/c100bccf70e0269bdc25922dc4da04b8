KAGERA Sugar Head Coach, Mecky Maxime has expressed satisfaction over his team’s progress following two consecutive wins in their recent Premier League matches held here at Kaitaba stadium. Maxime told the “Daily News” in an interview after Kagera Sugar punished Biashara United 3-0 on Wednesday that his boys were gaining momentum. “We started the league season on shaky footing, but slowly my boys were building their confidence winning three matches at the Kaitaba stadium,” he said. A few weeks ago, Kagera Sugar recorded a 1-0 win over JKT Tanzania and also beat KMC by same margin before gunning down Biashara United from Mara 3-0. Striker Erick Mwijage opened the score for Kagera Sugar scoring with a well-calculated shot in the 24th minute. Until half time Kagera were leading by the lone goal. In the second half, Kagera were more organised where Nassor Kapama and Hassan Mwateleko, respectively, scored the second and third goals in the 65th and 80th minutes. Kagera Sugar now stands on 12th position with 14 points after playing 12 matches. Biashara United FC Head Coach, Kenyan national Francis Baraza, on the other hand, conceded that his team made some mistakes that cost them dearly. “We made some mistakes…. but soccer is always a game of mistakes. We shall correct them and move forward,” he said.
