THE Prevention and Combating of Corruption Bureau (PCCB) has recovered 6.4bn/- and properties in the past six months in Arusha Region. PCCB Director-General Brig-Gen John Mbungo said the recovery of properties had been made by PCCB by making the culprits pay the tax they had evaded, recover some debts and other properties. Brig-Gen Mbungo said as PCCB they had done a great job and commended all those involved in the recovery of properties. He said making follow-ups, recovering and give back the properties of common people would be continued throughout the country. He explained that the work was done in accordance with the Prevention and Combating of Corruption Act, 2007. More than 294m/- belonging to cooperatives has been recovered either. Some helpless people were privately pursuing the debtors through abuse, fraud and other means. Some employers also were directed to repay their employees, while PCCB also stopped the illegal means of lending that was detrimental to the borrowers and also looked into issues related to business partners who had entered untenable agreements. Brig-Gen Mbungo noted that PCCB handed over a house title deed to its legal owner, Ms Anna Kamilembe, whose house had been grabbed by unscrupulous lenders. The house is worth 100m/- and is situated in Arusha City. The owner of the house said Brig-Gen Mbungo had secured a 27m/- credit facility and was slapped by a high interest rate. PCCB has also handed over three vehicles worth more than 85m/-, two belonging to Ms Hidaya Ally. The vehicles were indiscriminately taken by Mr Otto Makala who changed ownership and sold them to a third party. The third vehicle belongs to Tanzanite One Company. It was supposed to be auctioned to pay one of its employees, Mr Salum Ally, whose employment was illegally terminated in 2013. PCCB followed a judicial process and Mr Allyâ€™s vehicle was handed over to him in Arusha on Thursday this week.
