Seven people died and at least 45 were injured in protests that erupted after police arrested Ugandan presidential candidate and pop star Bobi Wine on Wednesday, Ugandan police said. “As of yesterday evening, we had seven people who lost their lives, about 45 people got injured including an LDU [armed civilian force] whose head was smashed,” police spokesperson Fred Enanga said. Mr Enanga claimed the National Unity Platform (NUP) led by Wine, who is also a lawmaker, violated election guidelines issued to contain the spread of Covid-19. The candidate is currently detained in Jinja following his arrest in Luuka where he had gone to campaign on Wednesday. “But it (NUP) doesn’t have control over these demonstrators. They don’t have the ability to restore a situation that has gone out of hand and yet they’re promoting violence. This is unacceptable,” Mr Enanga told state-owned Uganda Broadcasting Corporation (UBC) on Thursday morning.
