FORMER national team coach Hassan Kadio overcame five shot deficit to win TPC Open invited professional category by four shots. The Dar es Salaam Gymkhana Club-based golf pro, Kadio beat other title contenders to emerge victorious after posting an impressive two-over 146 strokes in the two- day tournament that covered 36 holes. The battle for pros started on Friday. Kadio started low with 76 gross strokes in the first 18 holes and went to the final round five shots adrift of the overnight leader and club-mate Aidan Nziku who started with a brilliant one under par 71 strokes. But, Kadio who grew up at TPC, showed everyone that he was very familiar with the course after marvelously grossing 70 strokes to claim the event’s top throne. The overnight leader and CDF Trophy sudden death winner Nziku could not repeat his first round form after returning 79 strokes to end with 150 total gross score. He finished second overall ahead of the Arusha Gymkhana Club (AGC) pro and long hitter, Nuru Mollel. Nziku, the former national team member who joined the paid rank recently, was keen to stamp double title after his first pro title he won during the CDF Trophy in September this year at Tanzania People’s Defence Forces (TPDF) Lugalo Golf Club of Dar es Salaam.
