A SIGH of relief has greeted the country’s construction sector after the Mbeya Cement Company launched a new product to substitute the fly ash that used to be imported in the construction industry. The company’s new product is called Lafarge Tembo Pozzi or pozzolana, launched over the weekend that will be a perfect substitute for imported fly ash in Tanzania. Statistically, Tanzania imports on average about 40,000 tonnes of fly ash annually used in the construction industry. During the launching ceremony in Dar es Salaam, Mr Evance Bernard, Head of Dar es Salaam’s sub-treasury of the ministry of Finance and Planning, said the government commended the company for the decision. “This would help the country reduce costs on importing the fly ash. By doing this the company lives up to its promise of being construction solution in Tanzania,” Mr Bernard said, while representing the ministry’s Permanent Secretary, Mr Dotto James. Company’s Chief Executive Officer Khaled Ghareib clarified that Pozzolana is a natural material that comes from volcanic ash and it has cementitious properties. “Taking advantage of the uniqueness and reactiveness of the locally available Pozzolana, Mbeya Cement Company with the help of LafargeHolcim Group’s Research & Development Centre has successfully researched use of processed and energetically modified pozzolana as substitute to imported fly ash for both soil stabilisation in road works and as an ingredient in concrete application to improve fluidity and durability properties,” he stated. The Company also known as LafargeHolcim Tanzania, has also inaugurated its new Head office located at RSquare Building in Masaki Dar es Salaam.
