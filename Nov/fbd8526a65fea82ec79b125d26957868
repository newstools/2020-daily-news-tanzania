THE Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Information, Culture, Arts and Sports, Dr Hassan Abbas, has advised journalists to publish stories that will bring about true social changes. He gave the advice at the weekend during his presentation during a two-day seminar to parliamentary reporters in Dodoma. He said proper reporting was part of the strategies that addressed various social challenges. According to Dr Abbas, with technological advancement, journalists need to keep abreast with social changes. “Journalists should not forget that they also have the responsibility to define and analyse some pressing issues, advocate positive changes so that members of the public could be well-informed on crucial issues affecting them,” said Dr Abbas. Dr Abbas cautioned reporters against a growing trend of stereotypes among journalists that their job was all about looking for mistakes, criticising and only showing the negative side to members of the public without proposing alternatives. “Journalists have to be part of the solution and not part of the problem. The media ought to collaborate with all three pillars of the state to find solutions to problems facing society,” he insisted. He said there was good relationship between Parliament and the media. However, he asked journalists to continue adhering to professionalism, objectivity and balanced reporting. Dr Abbas said journalists must know about parliamentary standing orders so that there could be no problem in their daily duties. “The Constitution of the United Republic of Tanzania and other international instruments all of them give us (journalists) the freedom to gather information from different sources, including Parliament, but we must adhere to the rules and code of ethics,” said Dr Abbas. However, he called on journalists all over the country who wished to report next parliamentary sessions, first to seek accreditation from the authorities.
