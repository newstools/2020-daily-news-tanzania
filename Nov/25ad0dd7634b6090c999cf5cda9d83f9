TANZANIA Private Sector Foundation (TPSF) has teamed up with Dodoma City to attract investments in the capital city. TPSF said the move aimed at wooing investors to invest in Dodoma and transform the city into an investment and business hub. TPSF Acting Executive Director Zack Mbenna said yesterday that the aim was to complement government efforts through cooperation with the private sector to promote development in the country. “We will use this opportunity to attract domestic and foreign investors to utilise opportunities available in Dodoma,” Mr Mbenna told the ‘Daily News’ in the sidelines of a stakeholders’ meeting in Dar es Salaam. He said priority areas to be promoted by TPSF included industries, logistics and transportation, agriculture and tourism. Dodoma City Council Economist Freddy Robert said Dodoma’s population was estimated at 510,038 people. “About 75 per cent people earn their living from agriculture and animal husbandry.” He said the remaining 25 per cent engaged in small-scale businesses such as retail shops, carpentry and food vending. The region, according to the economist, has power supply. Mr Robert said there were some reasons for investors to consider investing in the new capital city, one being a 507-hectare for a dry port, infrastructure and services. “This project links Dar es salaam and other regions as well as countries like Burundi, Rwanda and Uganda, which have their fleets passing through Dodoma,” he said.
