ABOUT 1,500 poor households in eight wards of Nyamagana and Ilemela districts have been connected to safe and clean water service through a ‘Flat Rate Cost' Project sponsored by the Netherland-based Vei Dutch Operators Company, with each household required to pay  21,000/- only. The four-year project, which kicked off in 2018 targets to benefit 6,000 poor households,  company project manager Reinder Van den Brink told the ‘Daily News’ mid-this week. About 2.4bn/- (£800,000) project targets to cover about 30,000 residents in 6,000 households. "The project will be finished in 2021.  Our aim is to support the fifth phase government in the provision of all important social services, including water. We serve all identified poor families, regardless of a wide interval between their homes and long distances of the houses from the main water pipeline," said Mr Brink, adding: “The company has been collaborating with Mwanza Urban Water Supply Authority (Mwauwasa) to ensure all people, including those in poor families, who are unable to pay water connection costs, have access to clean and safe water.” Commenting on how the company has been able to identify poor families, the Project Coordinator Tumaini Msaki said local government leaders had been running the exercise. Mwauwasa Deputy Director Leonard Msenyele expressed his gratitude to the company, saying it had been working almost day and night to ensure the project was completed in the targeted time frame. He said the government wanted all residents in the region to access safe and clean water. "May I ask the residents to be tolerant. I assure them they will all access clean and safe water,” he said. One of the beneficiaries in Kirumba Ward of Ilemela District, Ms Hadija Juma, said having access to safe and clean water would save a lot of time she used to spend on water.
