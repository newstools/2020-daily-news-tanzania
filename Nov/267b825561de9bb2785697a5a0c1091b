THE Inspector General of Police (IGP), Simon Sirro has said Police’s preliminary investigation has shown that some Tanzanians collaborated with Mozambique’s Alhau Sunnah Wal-Jamaah (ASWI) group which attacked some parts in Mtwara region. Speaking to journalists in Dar es Salaam on Thursday, (November 19, 2020), IGP Sirro said police are holding some Tanzanians who confessed to have been cooperating with the group. According to the Police boss, the unnamed people showed members of Alhau Sunnah Wal-Jamaah (ASWI) areas where they can attack. Sirro said the group had bad intentions as he advised parents and guardians living at the border of Tanzania and Mozambique to take care of their children since they could be recruited by the group.
